    <h3>Powerful Musings on the Muses’ Power</h3>
    <h5>November 20th, 2021</h5>
  </div>
  <div class="main">
    <p>The ancient Greek poet Hesiod serves as a timelessly influential figure in political thought. His <em>Theogony</em> details the origin of the gods, and a group of goddesses named the Muses inspire the words within it. As the daughters of Zeus and the goddess Memory, the Muses bridge political power and remembrance by their poetic speech. Upon an initial read, however, Hesiod’s work may appear to belittle the Muses since it depicts them as delicate, subordinate, and deceptive beings. Although Hesiod may seem to paint the Muses as powerless creatures throughout his <em>Theogony</em>, his use of effeminate diction, indirect references, and personal role in exemplifying their ability to influence and deceive suggest that their seeming weakness is actually true political strength.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Hesiod begins his <em>Theogony</em> with effeminate descriptions of the Muses. His first sentence directly juxtaposes these goddesses with their father Zeus, as he describes how the Muses “dance on their soft feet around the violet-dark fountain and the altar of Cronus’ mighty son” (Theogony 3). While contrasting softness and mightiness may appear to belittle the Muses in the wake of Zeus’s masculine power, the lines that follow suggest the opposite. As Hesiod continues to depict their choral dances, he details how the Muses “move nimbly with their feet” (3). Having just described their feet as “soft,” he thus qualifies their softness with flexibility. The nimble moves that the Muses make differ from the stationary obviousness of Zeus’s “violet-dark fountain” and rigidity of his “altar.” Even as the Muses perform “on highest Helicon,” they remain seemingly weak yet flexible, unlike Zeus who occupies a high place with firm conspicuousness. The Muses then walk by night from this clearly visible peak to deliver their voice, “shrouded in thick invisibility” (3). Once again, Hesiod’s diction may appear to suggest that like the night itself, the Muses are powerless in comparison to the shining day. However, the Muses actually gain their power from this night-day distinction. By travelling inconspicuously in the darkness rather than overtly in the light, the Muses most impactfully transmit their poetry. Similarly, by existing under the shadow of Zeus, they can continue to proliferate their voice with influence. For instance, Hesiod describes how “the house of their father, loud-thundering Zeus, rejoices at the goddesses’ lily-like voice, and snowy Olympus’ peak resounds, and the mansions of the immortals” (7). Though one might believe that the Muses therefore go unheard in the midst of Zeus’s loudness, the parallel structure of the line above suggests that loudness bears a double meaning. Zeus may be “loud-sounding,” causing Mount Olympus and the entire Earth to shake (39). But the Muses are effectively loud, as their soft and flexible voice influences the immortals. They send forth their poetry not with heavy-handed noise but with subtlety, and it is precisely from this distinction that they derive their power.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Another way in which the <em>Theogony</em> underscores the political strength of the Muses is through indirect rather than direct references to them. When describing how the Muses made him their mortal counterpart, Hesiod refers to the goddesses predominantly through his mention of Zeus. He describes them as “the Olympian Muses, the daughters of aegis-holding Zeus” and even removes their name altogether at times, referring to them simply as “great Zeus’ ready-speaking daughters” and “children of Zeus” (5, 11). Omitting a direct mention of the Muses might initially appear to depict them as powerless creatures, since they receive praise largely in reference to their father. However, Hesiod’s mentioning of the Muses mainly through their conspicuously powerful superior does not diminish their power. It instead does quite the opposite. With the burden of attention on Zeus, the Muses can continue to influence mortals and immortals alike, without the looming threat that their influence will end. Hesiod succinctly implies this when he details the means by which kings obtain wisdom. He begins by referring to the Muses as “the daughters of great Zeus,” once again diverting attention away from the Muses and onto their “mighty” father (9). He then summarizes how the Muses themselves enable kings to acquire soothing speech. Yet when he goes on to write, “For this is why kings are wise,” instead of proceeding to credit the Muses, he continues, “because when the populace is being harmed in the assembly [the kings] easily manage to turn the deeds around, effecting persuasion with mild words” (11). He omits directly stating that the Muses are the ones who allow kings to “[persuade] with mild words” in the first place. Lastly, when detailing the result of the kings’ persuasion, Hesiod states that they become “conspicuous among the assembled people” (11). By ending his description in this way, he subtly alludes to the fact that while the Muses continue to rule through covert influence, the overtness of kings can lead to the end of their power in politics. This reinforces the idea that weakness as portrayed through the Muses is not powerlessness but true political strength. The Muses remain unobtrusive while enabling kings and mortals to “[persuade] with mild words,” which originate from the Muses themselves. Although Hesiod does then proceed to reference the Muses directly, stating that it is because of them that mortals become poets, he writes, “but it is from Zeus that they are kings” (11). Thus, even when he directly acknowledges the Muses, the conspicuousness of Zeus shrouds them nonetheless.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The final way in which Hesiod suggests the power of the Muses is by serving as an example himself of the Muses’ ability to influence and deceive. Upon meeting Hesiod, the Muses claim, “We know how to say many false things similar to genuine ones, but we know, when we wish, how to proclaim true things” (5). Rather than explicitly stating that they can speak true and false statements, the Muses convey a rather simple idea in elegantly rhythmic speech. Even translated from the Greek, the soft sound of “when we wish” mimics their overall inconspicuousness, and its pleasantness to the ear further elucidates their ability to influence others through their delicate poetry. It suggests that by cloaking false statements in flowery speech, rather than proclaiming them plainly and overtly, the Muses are able to use their words to deceive those who hear them. Though the Muses tell of their aptness for deceit, it initially remains unclear whether they do in reality deceive. However, one line alludes to the fact that they apply their skill while whispering to Hesiod. The description of the theogony begins with two simple words—“in truth”—but specifying whether something were truthful would be rather redundant if the Muses spoke truth consistently (13). This suggests that the Muses do employ their aptitude for deception with Hesiod, as they emphasize a truth to him in the midst of many potential mistruths. Even though the Muses tell Hesiod of their ability to deceive, their poetic language itself prevents him from realizing it. In detailing the “maidenly whispers and smiles and deceits and sweet delight and fondness and gentleness” of Aphrodite, Hesiod’s language itself conceals “deceits” amidst flowing, lyrical diction (21). The structure of this sentence implies that traits commonly ascribed to effeminate weakness like soft speech and gentleness effectively conceal the Muses’ deceptions. In this sense, these traits are a form of power in politics, as they allow the Muses to shape political history through their “maidenly whispers.” Hesiod’s <em>Theogony</em> itself exemplifies this often overlooked truth. It is an ultimate testament to the immense political strength that lies in subtlety, for the inconspicuousness of the Muses allows them to share a message of choice to Hesiod that then proceeds to influence political life for thousands of years to come. Hesiod himself is even a poet like the Muses. He thus acknowledges the influence of soothing speech, even if he cannot understand the Muses’ ability to deceive him.</p>
    <br>
    <p>While a preliminary read of the <em>Theogony</em> may appear solely to underscore the mass misogyny of Hesiod’s time, further analysis suggests that the Muses hold true power in politics. Hesiod’s work conveys their strength through the ways in which it describes them, its indirect references to them, and ultimately, its suggestion that the Muses’ cloaked capacity for deceit enables them not only to contribute to politics but to guide it on their terms. Even Hesiod himself cannot know if the details within his <em>Theogony</em> are true, but he nevertheless shares them in a piece that has affected countless thinkers and people of influence for almost thirty centuries. By mimicking the Muses’ skill at poetry, Hesiod proceeds in his <em>Works and Days</em> to create a new memory of politics. He even specifically advocates for ordinary people and rulers alike to employ soothing speech, to be more like the Muses as he himself aims to do. But ultimately, Zeus continues to overshadow the Muses in Hesiod’s opening and throughout <em>Works and Days</em>. The inconspicuousness of Zeus’s daughters allows them to live on through his texts as seemingly weak creatures, which is exactly what paves the way for their unrivaled form of political power.</p>
