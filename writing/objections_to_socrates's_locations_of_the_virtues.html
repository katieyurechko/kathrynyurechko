    <h3>Objections to Socrates’s Locations of the Virtues</h3>
    <h5>November 5th, 2022</h5>
  </div>
  <div class="main">
    <p>In Plato’s Republic IV, Socrates locates wisdom, courage, moderation, and justice in his ideal city. I will argue that Socrates does not successfully locate and understand three of these virtues. First, by citing passages in the text, I will explain where the four virtues are located. Second, I will show that Socrates’s locations and understandings of wisdom, courage, and justice are incorrect, then consider objections to my view and respond to those objections. Finally, I will conclude that Socrates’s locations and understandings of wisdom, courage, and justice are incorrect.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Socrates establishes that since the ideal city is good, it must have all the virtues of a city: wisdom, courage, moderation, and justice. Since wisdom is knowledge about the city as a whole, wisdom is located with the guardians. Since courage is “the preservation of the belief, inculcated by the law and through education, about what things, and what sorts of things, inspire terror,” courage is located with the auxiliaries (Plato 300). Since moderation is “the mastery of certain sorts of pleasures and appetites” and is like a harmony, moderation is located across the whole city (Plato 301). Since justice is “doing one’s own work and not meddling with what is not one’s own,” justice is located across the whole city (Plato 302).</p>
    <br>
    <p>Socrates’s claim that wisdom is located with the guardians is incorrect. He defines wisdom by assigning it a particular scope: “the city as a whole” (Plato 299). But I object that it is impossible for the guardians to have knowledge about the city as a whole. Because a whole is the sum of its parts, to have knowledge about the city as a whole must be to have knowledge about each of its parts. The ideal city is composed of various parts that specialize in particular crafts. But the guardians only have knowledge about the particular craft of governing. Thus, wisdom is not located with the guardians.</p>
    <br>
    <p>A potential objection to my argument is that the guardians do have knowledge of the city as a whole because governing is about the city as a whole. But Socrates himself believes that definitions of concepts must be universal. By limiting his definition of wisdom to considerations of a city, Socrates identifies an example of wisdom but not its definition. If we modify the definition of wisdom to be knowledge about the whole of something, then the guardians exemplify wisdom because they have knowledge about the whole of the city. But on this view, skilled carpenters also exemplify wisdom because they have knowledge about the whole of carpentry. Therefore, wisdom is not located with the guardians alone but is located throughout the city.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Socrates’s claim that courage is located with the auxiliaries is incorrect. He compares the auxiliaries to wool and states that “they would absorb the laws in the best possible way, just like wool does a dye.” Their education would instill their beliefs so strongly that their beliefs “could not be washed out” (Plato 300). However, the auxiliaries are not analogous to wool, since they have emotions while wool does not. Unlike the dye in wool, the beliefs in auxiliaries can be removed through emotional experiences. For example, war can evoke terror in the auxiliaries even if they gain “the law-inculcated belief about what should inspire terror” (Plato 300). Therefore, courage is not located with the auxiliaries.</p>
    <br>
    <p>One might object that the education that the auxiliaries receive will make them unafraid. Thus, their beliefs about what should inspire terror will not be removed. For example, when discussing education in Book III of the Republic, Socrates and Adeimantus agree that stories hold the power to make the guardians “least likely to fear death” (Plato 272). But stories are not powerful enough to control human emotions like fear. Consider someone who is terrified of skydiving. One could tell this person stories of fearless skydivers, yet that person could fear skydiving nonetheless. Socrates might respond that a person will fear something only if they have heard stories of others fearing said thing. The auxiliaries will never read about wartime fear but only about wartime fearlessness, which will render them unafraid of death. However, I argue that a person’s sympathetic nervous system automatically triggers a response to situations that threaten survival. Stories that portray people as unafraid of lions will not stop the sympathetic nervous system from responding when a person encounters a lion. Thus, neither the auxiliaries nor any human being in the ideal city can be courageous in the Socratic sense.</p>
    <br>
    <p>A potential objection is that the ideal city’s practice of eugenics could eventually block sympathetic responses to fear in auxiliaries, so courage would be located with the auxiliaries (Plato 318). However, Glaucon and Socrates agree that “the sort of correct belief [about what should inspire fear] that you find in animals and slaves, which is not the result of education and has nothing at all to do with law, is called something other than courage” (Plato 300). A belief about what should inspire fear that is instilled through eugenics would not result from education. In addition, it would not be inculcated through the law because auxiliaries would be genetically programmed to follow the belief. Therefore, Socratic courage would not be located with the auxiliaries.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The Socratic definition of courage is incorrect. Socrates asks Adeimantus, “…do you think that anyone ever becomes courageous if he has that fear [of death] in his heart?” (Plato 272). He and Adeimantus then agree that a courageous person never fears death. But I argue that fear is a necessary ingredient for courage. For example, without me once being afraid of snakes, holding a snake could not make me courageous. Therefore, courage can only be located with those who first fear.</p>
    <br>
    <p>One might object that fear is not a necessary ingredient for courage. For example, many would consider a soldier to be courageous for fighting in wars even if that soldier has always fought without fear. But many consider the soldier to be courageous because they themselves fear fighting in wars. For the soldier, the act is analogous to the typical person’s experience with exercise. Both the soldier and the typical person participate in a physical act with an intended goal. But we would not call the typical person courageous for engaging in such an act unless they were once afraid to do it. Similarly, the soldier is not courageous for fighting in wars unless they were once afraid to do it. Thus, the Socratic definition of courage is incorrect.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Socrates’s claim that justice is located across the ideal city is incorrect. It rests on a false definition of justice, which involves a harmful lie. The lie that metals in people’s souls indicate whether they are capable of being guardians, auxiliaries, or craftspeople harms people by impeding their freedom to choose their own work (Plato 291). According to Socrates’s reasoning that “it is never just to harm anyone” (Plato 241), the Socratic definition of justice is founded on injustice. Justice is thus not located in the ideal city.</p>
    <br>
    <p>One might object that limiting people’s freedom does not harm them but instead protects them from harm. Since one’s belonging with the guardians, auxiliaries, or craftspeople is assigned based on an inspection of one’s soul, one cannot choose one’s work incorrectly and face harms through this wrongful choice. But the inspection of which metals are in people’s souls is dependent on human interpreters. Since one’s work is dictated by those who interpret the results of Socrates’s lie, Socratic justice is merely the advantage of the stronger. One might object that one’s work is not dependent on the lie but instead on tests. For example, potential guardians in the ideal city are watched from childhood and subjected to tests to determine whether they will become guardians (Plato 290). However, these tests are administered to potential guardians whom interpreters must first identify. Justice is still the advantage of the stronger, who harm the weaker. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Another objection is that the ideal city could breed human beings to be infallible interpreters of people’s souls, which would prevent harm from the interpretation process. However, fallible rulers must begin the eugenics project by initially identifying whom the “best men” and “best women” for breeding are (Plato 319). Once again, justice is the advantage of the stronger, who harm the weaker through their imperfect interpretation of whom is “best” (Plato 319). Therefore, justice is not located in the ideal city.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I have explained Socrates’s locations and understandings of the virtues. I have argued that Socrates’s locations and understandings of wisdom, courage, and justice are incorrect. I have considered all objections to my argument and successfully refuted them. Therefore, I can conclude that Socrates’s argument is not sound. Since Socrates’s argument rests on a narrow understanding of wisdom, wisdom is not located solely with the guardians but is located across the ideal city. Since Socrates’s argument relies on an impossible and false definition of courage, Socratic courage is not located with the auxiliaries, and true courage can only be located with those who first fear. Since Socrates’s argument depicts justice as the harmful advantage of the stronger, justice is not located within the ideal city. My argument did not successfully define wisdom, courage, and justice. However, it did show that Socrates’s understandings of these virtues are incorrect, which prevents Socrates from successfully locating them in his ideal city.</p>
