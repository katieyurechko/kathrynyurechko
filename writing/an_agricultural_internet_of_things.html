    <h3>An Agricultural Internet of Things: Revolution or Evolution?</h3>
    <h5>December 2021</h5>
  </div>
  <div class="main">
    <p>From organizing data with hierarchical tree structures to enabling users to “log” in to accounts online, computer scientists have long drawn upon natural concepts to enlighten their research and name their developments. In recent decades, this inspiration has evolved into a positive feedback loop in which not only does agriculture inform computer science but computer science informs agriculture. The Third Agricultural Revolution signaled a phasing out of traditional farming methods and an ushering in of new technologies, including those that paved the way for the up-and-coming internet of things (Montgomery 27). A network of physical objects embedded with software, the internet of things (IoT) has made its way onto 10% to 15% of American farms, with 1200 million hectares of farmland incorporating its technologies (Sung 4; Rovira-Más and Saiz-Rubio 2). But amidst decades of alleged progress, some individuals including the renowned environmental ethicist Aldo Leopold have feared that “we have invented engines of unprecedented coarseness and power, and placed them freely in the hands of ignorant men” (Leopold, “Conservation Economics” 350). Even Mike Judge’s comedy classic <em>Idiocracy</em> depicts a future civilization that waters its crops not with water but with Brawndo, a Gatorade-like sports drink. Such idiocy may seem outlandish, but research suggests that various hallmarks of industrial agricultural practices like spraying plants with synthetic fertilizers are analogous to watering crops with Brawndo. They damage the soil due to a technologically induced ignorance of how the soil actually functions (Kempf and Nichols 107-109). While IoT technologies may appear revolutionary in the agricultural realm, they are more akin to an evolution, intensifying the existing problems of conventional agriculture. The optimal response to these new technologies involves utilizing them to prompt a true agricultural revolution, since the IoT holds the power to promote environmentally conscious farming methods by augmenting human knowledge rather than inspiring ignorance.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The term IoT was devised by Kevin Ashton, a British technological innovator, just before the turn of the twenty-first century. He aimed to describe how IoT technologies provide a sort of “technological universe” in which many hardware and software devices work together to collect, transfer, and store information. While the traditional internet involves relationships between devices and human users, the IoT is an internet of non-human “things” that allows much machine-to-machine (M2M) communication to occur (Tzounis et al. 31-32). The structure of the IoT is based on three key layers: the perception layer, the network layer, and the application layer. The perception layer involves gathering data predominantly through physical sensors and surveillance devices. Dr. Matt Kleinhenz referenced these “grower-friendly” technologies in an interview with John Kempf, saying, “[They] can be implemented on the farm in terms of monitoring the environment and understanding the connections between the environment and the cropping outcome. These are sensors…the ones that will communicate with the grower through, for example, a cell phone or a computer if they have one” (Kempf and Kleinhenz 267). Sensors come in various forms—climate sensors that monitor weather events; radiation sensors that measure radiant energy waves, like light and heat from the sun; and ground sensors that surveil conditions within the soil, to name a few. They gather information that must then be transferred to devices to be made accessible to individual farmers (Tzounis et al. 38). The transfer process occurs in the network layer, a web of wireless sensor nodes that interact with each other and their external environment, including physical objects like robotic machines and vehicles, to forward information for storage (Tzounis et al. 34). Finally, the application layer enables users not only to retrieve stored data but to interact remotely with sensors and their surrounding environment via laptops, smartphones, and more (Tzounis et al. 39). The three-tier system of IoT technologies thus allows farmers to surveil and manipulate their environment both from a distance and in real time (Tzounis et al. 31). They can respond to minor or pressing issues with a mere click of a button, affecting their land through the M2M communication that a system of connected devices makes possible. For this reason, many consider the IoT to be a highly promising addition to modern agriculture.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Many potential benefits are associated with the use of the agricultural IoT. Most notably, the integration of sensor and surveillance technologies on farms supports the increasingly esteemed practice of precision agriculture, which aims to give farmers an extremely detailed picture of their land so that they can manage their crops most accurately (Sung 5-6). By gathering information from a network of physical entities, IoT technologies can organize knowledge into assessments of climate or crop status, even algorithmically generating predictions for farmers like warnings of potential dangers to their crops (Tzounis et al. 32). Three particular IoT applications hold promise for augmenting the knowledge that farmers have of their lands: field monitoring, Integrated Pest Management (IPM), and soil monitoring. In terms of field monitoring, sensors are able to map the situation on a given field with much precision, sometimes incorporating Geographical Information Systems to detail the view even further (Tzounis et al. 39). Image capturing via devices and processing via software can detect, track, and rate the threat potential of various animals and insects as well as recognize early signs of plant diseases (Tzounis et al. 35). Additionally, the IoT can aid IPM—an environmentally conscious way of managing pests (Thompson 54). Its physical motion sensors and cameras can surveil for pests, alerting farmers to their presence, and climate sensors can monitor weather trends that, once analyzed by software, can predict their appearance. IoT technologies can also compare crop growth with much detail to determine how different crops are affected by specific species (Tzounis et al. 39). Such data provides growers with the opportunity to respond to pests not simply by spraying pesticides, which kill both pests and their predators, but in ways that target the arrival of pests in the first place (Thompson 55). Lastly, farmers can input sensors into the ground at different depths to monitor the health of their soil. For example, Chinese farmer Tony Zhang utilizes soil sensors throughout his farm to observe “the microclimate of each crop.” His temperature sensors can detect a sharp increase in soil heat, which notifies him that a harmful bacterium may be present at the roots of specific plants. Humidity sensors, acidity sensors, and more alert him to critical microbial activity so that he can better understand the things that his eye cannot see (Little 120). Some sensors even allow farmers to gather data on soil nutrients. Soil moisture probes measure the underground presence of an extremely valuable plant nutrient—water—and NPK sensors gauge nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium levels in the soil (Sung 13; Ratnaparkhi). In addition to supporting individual farmers, IoT technologies can benefit suppliers and consumers by promoting food safety. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) utilizes radio waves to identify various products not only during production but after harvest. It underlies tag-based networks for simple product identification and tracking, which increase traceability in food supply chains (Tzounis et al. 35). While there are concerns regarding the accuracy and durability of sensors, the security of digital information, and the differential accessibility of IoT technologies by the type and size of farms as well as the age and education of farmers, the IoT is likely to improve in each of these areas given the exponential rate of technological advancement and proliferation (Tzounis et al. 43; Miles 3; Tardi). Some hold that like that of any new technology, the success of the IoT will ultimately depend not upon its promising capabilities but upon how it is applied in reality (Little 111).</p>
    <br>
    <p>The possible benefits introduced by the IoT have led many to claim that “farming is undergoing a digital revolution” (Miles 2). However, researcher Christopher Miles suggests that precision agriculture (PA), a key application of IoT technologies, is best understood not as a revolution but as an evolution of conventional agricultural practices. He holds that although PA promotes a shift in focus from field-level to subfield-level farming, it does not work to change the industrial paradigm upon which it is built. Instead, it further solidifies the paradigm through a technological approach (Miles 9). In this sense, PA is analogous to the mistakenly deemed Green “Revolution” that professor David Montgomery describes. The technologies introduced during the Green Revolution did not cause a “radical break” from the already-existent drive toward industrialized farming. They simply reinforced the chemical and mechanical field management techniques introduced in the precursory Third Agricultural Revolution (Miles 6; Montgomery 27; Thompson 45). I argue that much like PA and the Green Revolution, the agricultural IoT as applied today represents an evolutionary intensification of conventional industrial practices.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Three main examples illustrate the fact that while the IoT may appear revolutionary, it presently serves to uphold and cement harmful ideologies of industrial agriculture. First, growers with access to IoT technologies commonly utilize them to identify “unprofitable areas” to remove from rotation. When Christopher Miles asked a farmer to expound upon this phenomenon, the farmer replied that IoT devices help him discern areas that could be made more economically viable if he were to put in drainage tile rather than leave them fallow (Miles 9). As an addition to the industrialist paradigm, IoT technologies thus encourage the “fencerow to fencerow” mentality against which Aldo Leopold cautions in his “Illinois Bus Ride” essay. Leopold notably championed the necessity of biodiversity in maintaining a functional and stable ecosystem. Without leaving space for seemingly unimportant flora and fauna, farmlands under the conventional model tend to lack the mix of life that would promote their long-term productivity (Leopold, “A Sand County Almanac” 104-106, 188). The industrial ideal that contributes to diversity loss was largely disseminated in the early twentieth century. Encouraged by the Third Agricultural Revolution, farmers increasingly adhered to Earl Butz’s “get big or get out” mindset, focusing on yield maximization rather than the diverse plants and animals that made those yields possible. Entering the Green Revolution, farmers who once welcomed a variety of species onto their land increasingly began to follow an industrialist logic that promoted high yields alongside the use of inputs to achieve them (Montgomery 27). The IoT thus extends the drive toward large monocultures that the Third Agricultural Revolution initiated, which implies its evolutionary nature.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Second, the IoT encourages farmers to apply fertilizer more intelligently. As Montgomery describes, “That’s the idea behind precision fertilization. Systems…can place a little fertilizer just a couple of inches off to the side of the seed, giving the young plants what they need to grow” (Montgomery 102). By injecting nutrients into the space directly next to each seed at planting, farmers are able to reduce the rate at which they apply fertilizers. IoT technologies can now tell farmers which nutrients their soils are lacking and in approximately what quantities, making their fertilization much more precise and efficient. The modern industrialist mentality lauds the use of chemical inputs as a simple solution to nutrient deficiency in plants, with its only hesitation being the harms that result from chemical runoff. For this reason, IoT technologies introduced under the industrialist paradigm drive farmers to view pollution as the paramount or even sole issue with inputs (Sung 11). However, Dr. Kris Nichols highlights another significant consequence of input use by challenging the idea that synthetic fertilizers are what plants “need to grow.” A leader in the initiative to regenerate soil health, Nichols describes how artificial fertilizers turn plants into “couch potatoes.” Disengaged from symbiotic relationships with microbes, these “lazy” plants receive macronutrients from synthetic inputs but fail to gain the valuable micronutrients that microbes would otherwise provide (Kempf and Nichols 108). Synthetic fertilizers in any quantity diminish the health of the soil, therefore spawning an array of crops that lack essential minerals within a farming system that erroneously encourages the use of fertilizers as a means to providing those minerals. By furthering the idea that simply reducing synthetic fertilizer use is the ideal end goal, the IoT fails to signify a significant turning point in conventional farming practices.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Third, IoT sensors and mapping software tend to focus on crop yield, the predominant focus of practices already introduced in the Third Agricultural Revolution. Farmers ordinarily use sensors to monitor the yields of their crops, and software offered by companies like Monsanto, a forerunner in the herbicide business, takes images of fields and overlays the images with yield maps. Promoted by Monsanto itself, the software aims to highlight the need for herbicide and pesticide use. It encourages farmers to use variable rate technology (VRT) to determine the amount of inputs they should apply, never questioning whether inputs are the ideal response or even an effective response to weed or pest problems (Miles 4). Much evidence points to the fact that herbicides and pesticides respectively degrade soil health and stifle beneficial diversity, but IoT technologies as utilized today tend to push farmers to develop input-spraying plans rather than question the efficacy of doing so (Kempf and Kremer 71; Thompson 55). They follow the focus on yield, even though, as Gabe Brown suggests, “profit, not yield” is what is truly important, as profit promotes a focus on long-term over short-term gain (Brown 174). As these examples demonstrate, the IoT signifies an evolution of prevailing industrial ideals rather than a divide significant enough to constitute an agricultural revolution.</p>
    <br>
    <p>IoT technologies not only discourage farmers from acting on knowledge of soil health; they increasingly prohibit farmers from acting on their knowledge whatsoever. As part of the application layer, software can propose what it deems to be optimal ways for growers to respond to issues of nutrient deficiencies, pests, weeds, and more. However, instead of posing suggestions to which the grower responds, software can now trigger immediate responses (Tzounis et al. 34). Acting on algorithmically generated findings, IoT machines can automatically release chemicals to crops without human input, thus extricating the grower from the decision-making process (Sung 13). The approach of “remote-control farming” through which farmers ultimately direct machines quickly transitions into automatic farming, since robots common in the IoT can inject fertilizers or spray pesticides at the request of a computer algorithm alone (Little 120; Sung 9). Some suggest that algorithmically driven machines will eventually replace the need for human farmers altogether. As a farm machinery expert explains, “[Farming is] going to move towards a situation where the computer is taking that data and making decisions for the farmer all the time” (Miles 4). While farmers sleep, IoT robots can roam the fields, directed by mapping software, to complete any tasks that the software deems necessary. Researcher Jehoon Sung holds that “this dream will be a reality in the near future” (Sung 9). However, the “dream” of an automated IoT in agriculture appears to be a curse and not a splendor. IoT technologies already reinforce harmful industrial practices. Once fully automated, they can cement those practices indefinitely, delegitimizing human knowledge of agriculture in the midst of technological responses.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Aside from its applications, the IoT is evolutionary in a second, philosophical sense. Hans Jonas, a twentieth-century German philosopher, describes how technology itself is inherently philosophical since it is important to the fate of humankind and the environment (Jonas 34). However, technologies tend to present values in “the guise of simple, quantifiable, technical facts” (Miles 3). Those associated with the IoT are no exception. For instance, aggregating data from various sensors, cameras, and more into a unified, accessible whole builds a technological faith in farmers that often trumps their individual perspectives. Interviews reveal that farmers perceive algorithmic processes and the decisions they produce as “more correct, more accurate, and more precise” than their own knowledge. An Indiana grower specifically stated that machines present objective and infallible truths that are much unlike the subjective, fallible observations made by humankind (Miles 4). Though human beings design the software that reinforces the “fencerow to fencerow” approach, technology blinders prevent farmers from seeing that the allegedly objective truths presented by technology are expressions of human subjectivity (Miles 7). This faith in technology encourages farmers not only to execute more processes on the farm with technology but to understand the processes themselves through a technological lens (Miles 2). In this sense, the industrial values disguised as facts that are already present in several IoT applications shape how farmers view and engage with their land. By presenting its normative decisions as value-free responses, the IoT intensifies preexisting industrial agricultural ideologies and signals an evolution of prevailing practices.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In addition to propagating practical agricultural dangers, viewing IoT technologies as revolutionary engenders a philosophical risk. Hans Jonas describes how early civilizations reached a state of “technological saturation” fairly quickly and had little desire to surpass it. In other words, they arrived at an equilibrium of means and ends such that they felt no pressing need to continue inventing more technologies to transcend achieved goals. However, modern society tends not to reach that historical saturation point. The means-ends relationship is no longer linearly segmented but circular, as human beings typically wish to satisfy ends in a supposedly better way than they had previously been satisfied. In addition to suggesting new ends, technology tends to necessitate them by introducing new problems, thus causing the very issues that it is then sought out to solve (Jonas 35-36). For example, at the turn of the twentieth century, the continued rise in population prompted a shift toward industrialized, technological farming practices to feed the world. But those practices further encouraged the widespread use of the plow, which disrupts the fungal hyphae networks that provide micronutrients to plants. According to Montgomery, “Plowing wasn’t the solution—it was the problem,” so innovators developed synthetic fertilizers, which commercial interests then pitched as essential to delivering the nutrients that plants lacked (Montgomery 79). However, as discussed, these fertilizers generated a new problem in that they disrupted the symbiotic relationships between plants and microbes in the soil, once again depriving the plants of essential micronutrients. Modern agricultural applications of the IoT like precision fertilization simply prolong this means-ends cycle. They intensify the industrial agricultural paradigm not only by reinforcing cloaked industrial values but by their involvement in a chain of problems that prompt technological responses. More than generating new ends, technology tends to become the ultimate end. It is no longer simply a means to achieving predetermined goals but the goal itself (Jonas 37-38). Historically, the shift to industrial farming encouraged government agencies to seek what appeared to be groundbreaking revolutions. Commercial interests seized the opportunity to increase profits by developing high-tech fertilizers, herbicides, and more that would satisfy the growing desire for technological answers. Rather quickly, individual farmers began overlooking practices that emphasized soil microbiology in favor of seemingly revolutionary fixes. But the “technophilic narrative of progress” is a story propagated by profit-hungry corporations, and consistently looking outside the box for dazzling technological solutions tends to normalize the harms brought about by them (Montgomery 81). Even <em>Idiocracy</em> warns that relying on technological methods tends not only to obscure biological truths, like the fact that water nourishes plants, but to generate new issues likely to be addressed by big-tech innovations.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It is important to note that it might be foolish to assume that problems generated by technological responses can realistically be solved without them. It is extremely unlikely that civilization could revert to the days of minimal technology use or entirely tech-free problem-solving. Even if it could, eliminating technology is not the end goal. Devices coupled with software can be extremely helpful if used as knowledge-building tools, which the discussion of potential IoT benefits highlights. The ideal solution thus seems to involve utilizing technologies like those involved in the IoT in a conscientious way, rather than letting their seemingly revolutionary shine blind us to the problems they cause. Coupled with an eye toward the IoT’s potential to reinforce existing issues, this shift in perspective could allow civilization to reap the benefits of IoT technologies while not succumbing to their harms. The IoT as applied in agriculture holds the potential to augment human knowledge in a way that ignites a soil health revolution. While the automation of industrial ideals appears to be an obstacle, IoT technologies have not yet been programmed to deliver automatic responses on a large scale (Tzounis et al. 31; Miles 4). There is thus an opportunity for farmers who presently utilize the IoT to employ it as a means of enhancing their understanding of soil biology. They can use it to obtain detailed information about their land and the plants that grow upon it, rather than propagate industrial norms that strip their soils of vital nutrients and their operations of greater profits. Although the vision of farmers using the IoT in this way may seem a far-off dream, I hold that certain steps can make it a reality.</p>
    <br>
    <p>History has shown that consumer demand shapes production practices. For instance, consumers during the rise of the Third Industrial Revolution prompted a shift in production from a quantity- to quality-oriented focus. Their selective purchasing habits ushered in the need for greater transparency in the production cycle, specifically in terms of food production (Sung 9). Transparency in food processing has become necessary for farmers who wish to compete with large grocery chains like Kroger and Walmart (Miles 5). But this transparency is in terms of processing and packaging, not the practices that underly crop cultivation on farms. Consumers wanted safe products, and as climate change grew an ever-greater threat, purchasing trends signified an increased public interest in products with a smaller environmental footprint (Tzounis et al. 43). Consumers conveyed that they not only wanted human-safe products; they wanted products that did not significantly harm the environment through their production. In interviews, farmers from across the North and Midwest described “how critical market data are in deciding what crops or hybrids they choose to plant, as well as how, when, and why they offer futures contracts on their harvest” (Miles 4). Since consumers impact the agricultural production process so intimately, showing them exactly what happens to the food products they purchase before they purchase them could kickstart a soil health revolution. If consumers are made aware through data, visual evidence, and analyses of health and environmental trends that the nutrient-deficient foods they normally purchase harm their health and that of the environment, they will likely begin to seek out products that align with their demonstrated desires for product safety and environmental protection. Beginning with the wealthy who can afford the initially more expensive soil-safe products, shifts in consumer behavior could prompt a significant enough break from industrial ideals to constitute a true agricultural revolution.</p>
    <br>
    <p>For the IoT to promote a change in consumer practices, a significant number of farmers must initially utilize its technologies in ways that break from the norms of conventional agriculture. But as Montgomery states, “Our agricultural policies hold us back, discouraging farmers from using tools right beneath their feet” (Montgomery 26). Perverse incentives like those associated with crop insurance currently reward farmers for continuing to farm with an eye toward large monocultures, heavy inputs, and high yields (Montgomery 276). Short of establishing subsidies that encourage soil health practices, it is necessary that the government stop subsidizing practices that degrade soil health. Without incentives encouraging them to pursue the industrial model, farmers are more likely to use IoT technologies in a way that focuses on building the long-term health of their soil. They could equip consumers with a thorough and detailed understanding of what goes into the production of their food—for example, which nutrients are in the soil that gave birth to their crops and whether synthetic fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides were utilized in the growth of their food and in what quantities. Though IoT technologies cannot yet quantify the diversity of microbial life in the soil, there is potential for them to contribute to an index of soil health, since they can measure soil organic carbon, pH, and other valuable indicators of belowground conditions (Kempf and Kremer 70; Obade and Gaya). Online applications accessible via laptops, smartphones, and other devices could then allow consumers to understand the origin of their food more intimately, especially the health of the soil in which it was grown. Tony Zhang put this into practice on his organic operation in China. He wanted consumers to be able to participate in the process that grows their food, so he began to utilize an app that worked in conjunction with the IoT on his farm. The app stored data on each crop he grew in a way that allowed consumers to learn how it was grown, the quality of the soil in which it was grown, and even what the growing process looked like through access to camera footage. All that consumers had to do was scan the labels on the items they purchased or considered purchasing, and the data would present itself in a visually appealing, understandable format directly on their devices. Zhang believes that this practice will eventually make its way onto mainstream farms. As the IoT becomes more affordable for farmers, it will “trickle down” from higher-tech and higher-profit soil health operations like his own to become a common practice (Little 117-126). Though large corporations and commercial farming industries like those that back Kroger and Walmart may not initially utilize the IoT to build soil health, it is likely that the competition posed by soil health farms will drive even them to change. The pressure to make agricultural practices widely visible through the IoT will prevent farms that injure their soil from continuing to do so with the support of consumer dollars. They will no longer be able to rely on the invisibility of practices and the associated consumer ignorance that underly a large proportion of their economic success.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Montgomery states that “the most promising way forward [in the agricultural domain] lies in the marriage of agrotechnology and agroecology to rebuild soil fertility” (Montgomery 30). Throughout my paper, I argue that the IoT as applied in agriculture today tends to reinforce the conventional industrial model; however, I ultimately claim that it holds the power to spark a revolution of soil health. I begin by describing the agricultural IoT and its potential benefits in terms of promoting environmentally well-informed production practices. I then discuss the challenges that current uses of the IoT pose to the adoption of soil health methods, which provokes a discussion of the IoT’s evolutionary rather than revolutionary nature on both practical and philosophical grounds. Lastly, I evaluate the potential of consumers to drive changes in farming practices, arriving at my proposition that, while the IoT is evolutionary, it can give rise to an agricultural revolution after all. If utilized to shift the purchasing behaviors that affect farming decisions, the IoT can be a force for significant change alongside the elimination of industrial agricultural incentives. However, humankind must be cautious not to prolong the ignorance-inducing cycle of never-satisfied technological ends. Farmers, the public, and policymakers alike must be wary of any new harms that the agricultural IoT could produce, as well as the modern-day tendency to seek technological fixes to technologically generated problems. Society is in dire need of those who will monitor its progress. It needs the Socratic gadflies, the ones who will raise normative questions about seemingly value-free technologies (Plato 35). Their poking and prodding might be necessary to rouse the rest of us to understanding, lest we slumber in treacherous ignorance through an age of endless technological evolution.</p>
