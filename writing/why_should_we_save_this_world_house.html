    <h3>Why Should We Save This World House?</h3>
    <h5>October 26th, 2020</h5>
  </div>
  <div class="main">
    <p>Martin Luther King Junior describes the globe as a “great world house” that all its inhabitants have inherited and must come to occupy in peace (King 3). His call to action underlies a pivotal barrier to such harmony—the extensive poverty that unremittingly pervades the global sphere—and brings him to promote “passionate commitment” as the first step in alleviating this injustice (King 8). Unlike King’s focus on passion, or motivation, in inspiring a sustained response, renowned philosopher Peter Singer highlights each individual’s obligation to assist the global poor; he does so by employing a classic scenario in which a passerby must decide whether or not to save a child drowning in a pond. Singer holds that just as it is wrong for the passerby not to save the child and instead preserve his pair of shoes, it is immoral not to save the international poor by donating excess earnings (Singer 633). Many respond to Singer’s position by questioning whether they as individuals truly have moral obligations to address poverty across the globe. I argue that moral motivation rather than obligation must be the focus of prompting involvement in anti-poverty efforts, for it encourages both individual and national methods to address worldwide destitution and promote the greatest possible good for all.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The most compelling moral impetus for alleviating global poverty is that it harms not only the poor but all individuals, as it brings them into conflict with naturally human characteristics. Rather than originating from a feeling that poverty harms “them,” as in the poor around the world, an innate urge to help the poor finds its foundation in the truth that poverty harms “us” all as people of mankind. It does so in two critical ways. Firstly, the modern-day admiration of rugged individualism causes the average person to associate poverty with neediness and ultimately to act contrary to his or her human essence. It praises self-reliance, therefore allowing individuals not only to part with a possible sense of obligation to the poor but to feel morally justified in not engaging with them. As Timothy Weidel explains, “We have been convinced that an individual should be able to stand on his own two feet, and if a person is unable to do this, he is an affront to his own dignity as a human being” (Weidel 951). Neediness is thus seen as foolishness, while the ideal of the rugged individual retains its dignity. However, such praise of an independent being undermines the fact that the intrinsic nature of humanity is, as Karl Marx termed it, “species-being.” All manly creatures are not devoid of necessity but rather “imbued with neediness,” a critical need being that of forming relationships with others and receiving enrichment through such bonds (Weidel 952). Thus, in changing the channel when news of the international poor appears on television or crossing the street to avoid passing a homeless person alongside the road, human beings alienate themselves from their innate, interdependent selves. The existence of global poverty continually presents this conflict between the widespread ideology of rugged individualism and the interdependence of the human spirit.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The second way in which universal poverty harms all individuals is that it promotes “bad faith,” or lies that often aim to hide something from oneself that he or she knows to be true. To illustrate this, imagine a beggar at a street corner. When nearing the beggar, one’s human impulse to respond to another’s needs typically transforms into some form of self-deceiving untruth. One may tell oneself that the beggar will use any money that he receives immorally and thus decide to walk by without acknowledging him. Whether or not this exact idea is true, the notion that it excuses one from acknowledging the beggar’s humanity is an inherently harmful form of self-deception. Individuals use it as a coping strategy: “the more distance we put between ourselves and the poor person, the better we feel” (Weidel 954). As a means of protection from the painful realities of poverty, human beings suppress their humanity over and over again in response to the appeals of both the global and local poor, such as the beggar at the street corner. They ultimately deceive themselves into being able to ignore those in need through a systematic denial of their “species-being” impulse to connect with those whom they encounter. Such responses promote a cycle of inaction when it comes to addressing poverty across the globe. Some may question whether the moral concerns I raise over ignoring the beggar are still applicable to the global poor. They may even hold that individuals have different obligations to those near them who are in need. However, I posit that by addressing the poor locally, human beings simultaneously work to further anti-poverty efforts globally. They acknowledge the innate humanity of both themselves and the impoverished people whom they address regardless of geographic location, which ultimately dispels notions of rugged individualism and practices of self-deception to promote poverty alleviation in both the national and international realms. Ultimately, any moral imperative promoting assistance of the poor must focus on human motivation; it must highlight the far-reaching consequences of poverty for all to encourage widespread action.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Because a natural human sympathy exists within each individual, acknowledging rather than suppressing such compassion would work to alleviate the communal harm that poverty engenders through both personal and collective efforts. I have already discussed the ways in which widespread destitution affects each individual and how this promotes motivation as the basis of anti-poverty efforts. King appends a nuanced idea to this position, that such motivation must fuel sustained commitment to make the greatest positive impact. While King and Weidel differ in their perspectives on the proper basis of motivation, as King believes in a “selfless” or group-minded origin and Weidel in a self-focused one, they both agree, as King states, that “we cannot preserve self without being concerned about preserving other selves” (King 8). I argue that “passionate commitment,” which King details as “the first step in the world-wide war against poverty,” is fueled by the true motivation of which Weidel speaks in two ways (King 8). First, an intrinsic desire to honor one’s human essence encourages one to address the poor, which works to dismantle the ideology that neediness is weakness and self-reliance is strength. Through just one instance of conversing with a beggar, an individual holds the power to alter the mindset of each person who witnesses the exchange. Weidel uses an analogy of a machine with many cogs: in an interconnected world, all of the cogs fit together and work to turn others, just as an individual’s actions motivate others to act as well (Weidel 959). By choosing to engage with the poor rather than turn away, human beings reinforce a “passionate commitment” to honoring the dignity of all people and working to eradicate poverty. Second, applied individual motivation can work to change the structures that propagate such an evil. Weidel acknowledges that an individual instance of giving money to a beggar will not eliminate global poverty; however, he makes clear that the human motivation to engage as species-beings most definitely can (Weidel 958). Through personal actions, individuals come to reflect on poverty as a system of causes and effects, which reveals a political component that exceeds any one-on-one interaction between persons (Weidel 955). This dimension calls on the inborn desire of all persons to act as species-beings by getting involved in their nation’s efforts to combat poverty, whether it be through donating to philanthropic initiatives, lobbying to amend unjust policies, or campaigning to reform structures like the World Trade Organization that exclude poor nations from decision-making processes and tolerate harmful practices of developed-world protectionism (Pogge 660). Some may argue that individual action like giving to beggars is not necessary in alleviating global poverty. They instead pose that focusing purely on national efforts to change systems can and will fulfill such a mission. I argue that, as Weidel states, “a better system will not automatically ensure a better life” (Weidel 960). Rather, only by working to create a better life from an initial acknowledgement of the humanity and inherent neediness of each individual can a better system evolve. Individuals must consistently act on the understanding that “both rich and poor are tied together. They entered the same mysterious gateway of human birth, into the same adventure of mortal life” (King 10). With individual and collective action grounded in passionate motivation, human beings can actively work to eradicate poverty worldwide.</p>
    <br>
    <p>One objection to my argument is that a sense of moral obligation rather than motivation should lie at the core of the fight against poverty. Proponents of this view include Singer and Pogge. Through his child in the pond scenario, Singer rhetorically probes, “Is it possible that by choosing to spend your money on [nonessentials] rather than contributing to an aid agency, you are leaving a child to die, a child you could have saved?” (Singer 634). Pogge similarly poses that because rich nations are responsible for imposing harms on the poor throughout history, they must respond; he states that citizens of wealthy countries, which initiated and uphold unjust institutions, are “guilty of the largest crime against humanity ever committed”: the deaths inflicted by persistently severe global poverty (Pogge 657). However, I respond that views like these emphasize guilt and that invoking such an emotion is not efficacious, as a “liability model” does not effectively inspire a will to act. Rather, those who find themselves to be targets of blame respond defensively; they seek excuses to diminish their culpability (Weidel 948). For example, in response to Singer’s pond hypothetical, many argue that because they work for their money, they have a right to spend it on themselves instead of give all excess away (Singer 640). Those responding to Pogge sometimes claim that the global order is not unjust, so rich nations are not responsible for rectifying issues of poverty (Risse). Both of these answers exhibit a guilt-triggered response, an attempt at expelling oneself or even wealthy nations as a whole of any sense of moral obligation. “Guilting” people into acting therefore prompts them to evade acting, whereas directing them to realize the ways in which poverty harms all individuals inspires actual change. Even if individuals do have a moral obligation to eradicate global poverty, as Singer and Pogge posit, I contend that because a sense of obligation is ineffective in inspiring action, it should not be used as an incentive to act. As King states, “There is no deficit in human resources [in combatting poverty]; the deficit is in human will” (King 8). Motivation grounded in one’s natural sense of human compassion is thus critical in targeting this will, for it works to engage individuals in poverty alleviation measures and therefore foster the most possible good. A related objection to my argument is that the desire to help that I explained is immoral because it focuses on selfishness. By this, proponents hold that in addressing the poor with such a desire, one egocentrically tries to better one’s own connection with his or her innate humanity. King himself even states that the Good Samaritan’s question—“If I do not stop to help this man, what will happen to him?”—is the just one to ask because it rejects a self-centered mindset. However, I argue that the motivation I described above is not “me”-centric but “us”-centric. Just like those working to expel poverty, the Good Samaritan should also consider, “If I do not stop to help this man, what will happen to me?” (Weidel 957). This others-centered view of poverty is just because it acknowledges the dignity inherent in each human person, rich or poor, rather than isolating people experiencing poverty as infinitely unlike oneself. Because it is founded in species-being, such a motivation acknowledges that all people have needs and that all are affected by how others respond to those needs; it does not attempt to suppress inherent human qualities but instead embraces them. Claims of this perspective’s “selfishness” neglect that its adherents realize the personal and universal implications of leaving a poor person to die or allowing global institutions to exploit the impoverished. They fail to address that proponents act for “us,” not simply for “him” or “her” or “me.” Therefore, Weidel’s motivation justly draws on one’s human essence rather than defense-triggering guilt to promote positive global action.</p>
    <br>
    <p>King’s image of a world house stresses the interconnected nature of all human beings. Throughout my paper, I elaborate upon this original premise by arguing that a moral motivation grounded in this reality best promotes both individual and collective efforts to alleviate poverty. I begin by explaining in what ways the existence of poverty across the globe harms all persons and how this serves as the paramount moral impetus to eradicate it. I then describe how this motivation successfully encourages human beings to combat poverty both personally and communally. I conclude my argument by refuting the objection that moral obligation should underly one’s assistance of the global poor; rather, I maintain that an innately human desire to alleviate poverty is not only more effective in its mission but is both honest and just. These steps together promote my argument that human beings have an inherent motivation to help the poor, as doing so betters not only the impoverished but all of mankind. Realizing this truth would drive each person to work individually and in conjunction with others to promote change, thus fostering a world house that functions more closely like a home.</p>
