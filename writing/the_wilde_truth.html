    <h3>The Wilde Truth: Analyzing the Relation between Body and Soul</h3>
    <h5>January 12th, 2020</h5>
  </div>
  <div class="main">
    <p>In his 1813 piece <em>The Reunion of the Soul and the Body</em>, painter William Blake depicts a soul as a person returning to its frame; however, the two have entirely different appearances, even being of different sexes (See Fig. 1). This discrepancy causes viewers to call both their individual beliefs and Blake’s credibility into question. How can he claim that “man has no Body distinct from his soul; for that called Body is a portion of a Soul” yet clearly acknowledge their dissimilarity? Most scientists avoid this quandary by simply refusing to acknowledge that a spirit exists. They immerse themselves in the tangible, while philosophers and theologians admire what the human hand cannot grasp, noting that the bridge between the concrete and abstract cannot be merely ignored. Oscar Wilde is yet another player in this timeless game, but through a novel in which protagonist Dorian Gray sells his soul for bodily beauty, he brings a multifaceted and solidified perspective to the centuries-old debate. In <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em>, Wilde uncovers the intricate disparity yet ultimate bond between body and soul through subliminal paradoxes, complex character relationships, and philosophical symbolism. </p>

    <br>
    <p>Paradoxical images of nature’s beauty elucidate the discrepancy between the body’s outer features and the soul’s inner truth. This concept surfaces in the novel’s opening lines as the narrator describes the scene: “The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses…the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate perfume of the pink-flowering thorn” (Wilde 4). By portraying the gentle lilac as having a “heavy” scent and the harsh thorn as smelling “delicate,” Wilde already challenges readers’ expectations. This enigmatic statement at the very beginning of the novel calls his audience to understand from the start that inner and outer state are not synonymous; the thorn, inherently evil, can still have a beautiful and alluring smell, just as the lilac, gorgeous and graceful, can bear a heavy burden. Wilde’s use of synesthesia in describing the lilac’s scent as having a tactile weight suggests the interrelated nature of the tangible and intangible; however, the paradox itself warns readers not to associate aesthetic pleasure with inner goodness, and vice versa. This notion of bodily charm and inner turmoil resurfaces in the following lines as the narrator describes a laburnum “whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs” (4). The association of “burden” with “beauty” presents an anomaly in and of itself, and the alliteration of these words with “bear” makes clear the defeated state of the branches while sustaining such “flamelike” outer glory. By bewildering his audience with this image of stunning yet suffering branches, Wilde further highlights the difference between one’s spirit and outward appearance. His use of subtle paradoxes cautions readers not to confuse the conscience with its frame as he stresses the fine disparity between the two.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Dorian’s paradoxical existence as a beautifully terrible being clarifies the distinction between one’s physical appearance and inner self. As Lord Henry comes to know Dorian and marvel at his beauty, the narrator remarks on his behalf, “There was something fascinating in this son of love and death” (25). The notion that a human person could be born of such contradictory, abstract concepts presents an anomaly for readers and, in doing so, alludes to the dissimilarity between body and soul. Love, an emotion associated with physical desire, and death, a physical state tied to its preceding inner turmoil, complicate a clear divide between the psyche with its emotions and the human person’s physicality. While the paradoxical depiction of Dorian as being born of both “love and death” suggests some deeper unity between the two entities, it predominantly stresses how his inner and outer self are not explicitly the same. As a metaphorical son of such polarized phenomena, he is genetically predisposed to both good and evil, inside and out. Dorian himself makes this perfectly clear as he says to Basil that “each of us has heaven and hell in him” (99). While this statement at first appears to be nonsensical, since such drastically different places cannot exist simultaneously, let alone within a singular person, it elucidates the truth that angelic looks can indeed endure despite cruel acts and desires. Wilde relates this description back to his point about the coexistence of beauty and burden by explaining that Dorian’s “sorrows stir [his] sense of beauty, and [his] wounds are like red roses” (38). This anomalous statement proves that even the evil inside Dorian can enhance his outer appeal. The simile comparing his wounds to “red roses” as well as the euphonic alliteration of the “s” sound at the start of the quote expose the blissful deception mankind undergoes when it deems one’s good looks indicative of a pure conscience. Dorian himself serves as a paradox to illuminate the intricate discrepancy between form and spirit.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Lord Henry’s continual employment of paradoxical language indicates that though body and soul may appear parallel, they are not to be mistaken for one another. In disrupting a conversation between his wife and Dorian, Lord Henry claims, “Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing” (31). This assertion poses an initial quandary for readers because “price” and “value” appear to be the same, yet Lord Henry declares there to be a difference between the two. By situating the conclusion of this quote in parallel structure, Wilde urges his audience to discover that the word “value” suggests an emotional worth, whereas “price” merely refers to the monetary sum something requires. Therefore, through the inclusion of this subtle disparity, Wilde propels readers to unveil for themselves the distinction between one’s intrinsic “value” and the body’s outer “price,” or earthly beauty. Lord Henry further illuminates this discrepancy through his declaration that “the tragedy of old age is not that one is old, but that one is young” (135). This contradictory claim, by directly juxtaposing the adjectives “old” and “young,” again calls readers to recognize the implication of the words themselves. “Old” holds a double meaning: its denotation of the age that brings with it a worn appearance and its later connotation of a weakened and rotted soul. Thus, by drawing a parallel between the body’s “old age” and being “young,” or pure at heart, Wilde makes clear that a person’s exterior and interior qualities are not to be confused, just as his nature imagery and description of Dorian advise. Wilde’s subliminal distinctions within Lord Henry’s paradoxical assertions illuminate the discrepancy between physique and spirit that his audience must come to uncover.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Basil’s relationship with Dorian as the creator of his painting mirrors God’s relationship with those made in His image, suggesting that body and soul are meant to be one. While introducing Basil’s fascination with Dorian, the narrator refers to the former not by name but rather as “the painter” (7). This substitution instills in readers a sense of Basil’s connection with Dorian from the very beginning; Dorian is the work into which he has poured his dignity and desires, just as God creates humans to be morally good like Him. When speaking about his love of Dorian with Lord Henry, Basil even exclaims, “The harmony of soul and body—how much that is! We in our madness have separated the two, and have invented a realism that is vulgar” (9). Dorian being, in Basil’s eyes, purely beautiful in both form and spirit, “the painter” praises the perfect union his creation has maintained between the worldly and divine. He adores the untainted life God intended all humans to have, which he finds in the harmony of Dorian’s conscience and good looks; however, the irony in this quote is that Basil delivers it before Lord Henry, his closest companion, without knowing Lord Henry would come to corrupt his angel, just as the Devil betrayed the divine. As Dorian grows tainted with sin from succumbing to Lord Henry’s temptations, his creator cries out one final, succinct desire: “I want the Dorian Gray I used to paint” (69). Basil’s obsession with retrieving the Dorian whose body and soul were equally pure perfectly mirrors the divinity’s wish for the innocence of each newborn to persist throughout the lives of all those He creates. The special love Basil holds for his creation reveals God’s intent for the tangible and intangible not to deceive as differing entities but rather to remain as one.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Lord Henry’s relationship with Dorian as the Devil corrupting the innocent demonstrates how a glorifying perspective on the body contaminates one’s conscience. In his first conversation with Dorian, Lord Henry exaggerates the importance of outer beauty, shouting, “Youth! Youth! There is absolutely nothing in the world but youth!” (17). This explicit use of hyperbole paired with the repetition of exclamation points and the word “youth” itself portrays the immensity of Lord Henry’s desire to bring the innocent’s focus away from his soul and toward his earthly state. This deliberate manipulation immediately convinces Dorian that “the life that was to make his soul would mar his body,” thus signaling a distinct disparity between Basil’s godly intention for the spiritual and corporal to remain united and Lord Henry’s devilish wish to sever the connection (18). However, as Dorian heeds Lord Henry’s later advice to maintain his youthful beauty, he ironically comes to learn that the reverse of his previous realization also holds true: to make his body would mar his soul. While Dorian watches his worldly pursuit of grandeur disfigure his face in Basil’s painting, his spirit becomes engulfed in torment, leading him to proclaim that “he would not see Lord Henry any more—would not, at any rate, listen to those subtle poisonous theories that in Basil Hallward’s garden had first stirred within him the passion for impossible things” (59). This reference to “Basil Hallward’s garden” alludes to God’s Garden of Eden, where the Devil tempted the innocent in the form of a “poisonous” snake. Through this intricate allusion, Wilde draws a distinct parallel between Lord Henry’s “poisonous theories” and those of the Devil, thus suggesting the ultimate ruin of one’s conscience that accompanies submission to such physical pleasures. Dorian’s eventual destruction as a result of his relationship with Lord Henry proves the dangers of pursuing physical glory rather than honoring one’s essential nature.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The parallel between Dorian and Sibyl Vane proves the inefficacy of bodily beauty in shielding the soul from harm. In the midst of Dorian’s progression, Wilde reveals that “no winter marred his face or stained his flowerlike bloom” (87). This representation of Dorian as such a fragile part of nature calls into question his paradoxical ability to remain intact and even grow through winter. By employing imagery to depict Dorian’s development as “flowerlike,” Wilde suggests that though he has been able to survive metaphorical winters of turmoil, this would not always remain the case. When Dorian first meets Sibyl Vane, this same idea of a blossom’s delicacy resurfaces as he implores Lord Henry to “imagine a girl, hardly seventeen years of age, with a little, flowerlike face…eyes that were violet wells of passion, lips that were like the petals of a rose” (34). This overwhelming image of Sibyl’s entire being as floral elucidates her profuse innocence and delicacy. Whereas Dorian mirrors a flower in his outward appearance, Sibyl is like a blossom both inside and out. Her “violet wells of passion,” however, soon deplete with Dorian’s cruelty. Having only a tormented soul and outer beauty left to protect her, Sibyl kills herself, leading the narrator to explain, “The moment she touched actual life, she marred it, and it marred her, and so she passed away” (66). This personification of life as a being capable of destroying those who partake in it illustrates that same burden the beautiful branches outside Basil’s studio experience. However, in Sibyl’s case, her inner turmoil acts not only as a burden but a deadly affliction that brings her to take her own life, leaving her beauty and innocence nothing but a “trampled flower” (57). The parallel Wilde draws between Dorian and Sibyl through their “flowerlike” forms and tortured spirits ultimately foreshadows Dorian’s own suicidal demise. His description of Sibyl mirrors his same illustration of Dorian to underscore the mutual fragility of their beauty and its fatal inability to safeguard their souls.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Wilde employs flowers to symbolize the unity of one’s outer appearance and inner state, as the deterioration of the former accompanies that of the latter. When Lord Henry begins to exert his devilish influence over Dorian, he says to him, “Time is jealous of you, and wars against your lilies and your roses. You will become sallow, and hollow-cheeked, and dull-eyed. You will suffer horribly” (17). Dorian’s figurative “lilies” and “roses” are not only his outward beauty but his inward innocence and delicacy, so when Lord Henry personifies time to claim it will destroy Dorian’s good looks, he also alludes to the fact that such bodily deterioration will undoubtedly affect Dorian’s soul. Upon receiving this warning, Dorian drops a floret he held in his hand, prompting the narrator to note that it “seemed to quiver” (17). By attributing a word used to describe physical movement to a blossom that Dorian let fall, Wilde connects corporal demise with emotional ruin to mirror the bond between body and spirit. He then builds upon this interpretation as Dorian marvels at the passing of his youth, reminiscing, “Years ago, when I was a boy,” while simultaneously “crushing [a] flower in his hand” (98). This pairing of dialogue with action not only furthers the abstract meaning of the flower but clearly portrays Dorian’s frustration at his portrait’s loss of youthful appeal. He crushes floral beauty as a result of this “crushing” realization, proving that the decline of his corporal splendor, just like the blossom’s, will coincide with the destruction of his inner self. By utilizing flowers to signify the unified nature of body and soul, Wilde illustrates the vital connection that exists between the two.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The color white shifts from symbolizing beauty to representing death to illuminate the bond between one’s outer features and inner spirit. When first describing Dorian’s appearance, Lord Henry refers to him as a “young Adonis, who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose-leaves” (5). In Greek mythology, Adonis is a gorgeous young god adored by two goddesses; he is the ideal standard of attraction, so by employing this allusion, Wilde explicitly connects the color white found in the “ivory” Lord Henry mentions with the concept of beauty itself. However, the reference to “rose-leaves” in this same line once again suggests the paradoxical discrepancy between body and soul. Unlike a rose’s alluring petals, rose-leaves are dangerously sharp and carry maladies to the rest of the flower, implying that even beings made of “ivory” like Dorian can succumb to inner turmoil and death. The connection between white and luster of appearance continues to develop as the “young Adonis” addresses Basil, saying, “I am less to you than your ivory Hermes or your silver Faun. You will like them always. How long will you like me?” (19). By referencing these gods, Dorian claims that Basil will forever love what is “silver” and “ivory,” a beautiful shade of white; however, he fears that, unlike these godly statues, he will lose his unblemished attraction with age. This intuition eventually becomes a reality as the color ages like Dorian’s portrait to take on a changed meaning. While Sibyl Vane grows in her love of Dorian, the narrator remarks that “a white dust—tremulous cloud of orris-root it seemed—hung in the panting air” (45). This peculiar image painted through the suspension of a “white dust” that not even the air itself is able to bear engenders a foreboding mood, for the dust’s seeming composition of “orris-root” suggests a medical tragedy, much like that of Sibyl Vane’s impending death by poison, that would require it as treatment. These details indicate a new purpose for the color white; rather than signifying beauty, it fades to ruin, representing the tragic deaths characters like Sibyl and Dorian ultimately face. By establishing white as a symbol of corporal beauty then inward pain, Wilde further discloses the eternal connection between one’s outer features and inner spirit.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Dorian’s challenge against and final destruction of his portrait symbolically prove the irrefutable bond of body and soul. Before hearing of Sibyl Vane’s death, Lord Henry teases Dorian about his desire to be morally good, prompting him to disclose, “I can’t bear the idea of my soul being hideous” (62). This craving of Dorian’s for an untainted spirit originates from his encounter with his own face warped and twisted on his previously stunning portrait. Not only is this representation of Dorian’s conscience “hideous,” but Dorian himself begins to perceive his appearance as inherently tied to his inner state. He acknowledges the bond between his frame and psyche but attempts to evade it, which leads the narrator to pose such rhetorical questions as, “Why should he watch the hideous corruption of his soul? He kept his youth—that was enough” (78). Although Dorian’s picture deforms with his evil acts, he tries to avoid this truth; however, a question like this followed by such laconic, finite statements as “that was enough” suggests that Dorian is merely deceiving himself into believing his youth can be sufficient. In a delirious state, he eventually insists on showing Basil the horrid condition of his painting, so he unveils the secret he had once used all his strength to conceal. Upon seeing this atrocity, Basil confusedly utters, “You told me you had destroyed it,” prompting Dorian to explain, “I was wrong. It has destroyed me” (98). This brief exchange succinctly illuminates the true dynamic between the physical and spiritual: while one can claim that his bodily strength holds the authority over his own psyche, in reality, there exists a shared power between the two. Dorian watching the face in his picture distort symbolically expresses the madness one undergoes in trying to escape the ultimate bond that body and soul share. In the novel’s final scene, the conflict between Dorian and his portrait culminates in one thrilling moment of situational irony: Dorian stabs the painting, expecting to kill his conscience, but the knife ends up in his own heart as he lies “withered, wrinkled, loathsome of visage” while the picture recaptures the “wonder of his exquisite youth and beauty” (140). Wilde’s rough use of asyndeton in recounting the deteriorated state of Dorian’s corpse as opposed to his smooth description of Dorian’s “exquisite” portrait suggests the lasting power of the soul in relation to its physique; by demolishing his true being, Dorian inevitably destroys his own presence, figuratively expressing the universal truth that body and spirit are forever bound. By depicting the philosophical enigma of the conscience and its frame through Dorian’s symbolic interactions with his portrait, Wilde makes clear the connection the two entities forever share.</p>
    <br>
    <p>A principle duty of literature is to elucidate the truths that its readers might not otherwise come to understand. Though William Blake’s painting and verbal opinion contribute his perspective to the world, their contradictory nature presents a quandary rather than a coherent claim. This is why Oscar Wilde stands apart from the centuries of scholars like Blake himself. Through his renowned novel The Picture of Dorian Gray, Wilde brilliantly draws on a variety of perspectives to present a truly comprehensive interpretation. His incorporation of paradoxical warnings, personal relationships, and profound symbols within mere turns of a page clarifies the potency of interweaving the tangible and intangible, the concrete and abstract, into a unified whole. Just as body and soul have their differences yet remain connected throughout time, Wilde’s complex work will continue to shape the world because of his ingenuity. By imparting upon readers the distinction yet eternal bond between such fundamental units of human existence, Wilde successfully appends an all-encompassing and timeless perspective to humanity’s search for philosophical truth.</p>
