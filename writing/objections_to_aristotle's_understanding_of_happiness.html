    <h3>Objections to Aristotle’s Understanding of Happiness</h3>
    <h5>December 3rd, 2022</h5>
  </div>
  <div class="main">
    <p>In his Nicomachean Ethics I, Aristotle identifies the highest good that is the ultimate end for human beings: happiness. I will argue that Aristotle does not correctly understand happiness. First, by citing passages in the text, I will explain how Aristotle understands happiness. Second, I will show that Aristotle’s understanding of happiness is incorrect, then consider objections to my view and respond to those objections. Finally, I will conclude that Aristotle’s understanding of happiness is incorrect, which renders his argument unsound.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Aristotle claims that every action seeks some good. He describes two kinds of goods: intrinsic and extrinsic goods. Intrinsic goods are valued for their own sake, while extrinsic goods are valued insofar as they promote the attainment of intrinsic goods. Since intrinsic goods are higher than extrinsic goods and happiness is the highest intrinsic good, happiness is the highest good overall. Aristotle explains that the “the function of a human being is activity of the soul in accord with reason,” which guides one to practice the virtues (Aristotle 581). Since happiness is “the best and most complete” virtue, all human activities ultimately seek happiness. Thus, the ultimate purpose of a human being is to be happy (Aristotle 581).</p>
    <br>
    <p>Aristotle’s claim that happiness is the ultimate goal of all human activities is false. Consider someone who engages in acts of self-harm to cope with clinical depression. By pushing one’s threat response to its maximum through self-harm, one experiences sensations similar to those in an opioid rush. One often continues to engage in self-harm not to trigger happiness, which one can interpret to mean a lasting sense of fulfillment, but to trigger what John Stuart Mill terms a lower pleasure, or temporary satisfaction. A potential objection is that someone self-harming is nonetheless aiming for happiness. Self-harm might be the only thing that one knows to do to aim for happiness. But some who self-harm know that the act will not bring happiness, since self-harm furthers an isolating cycle of addiction that disrupts interpersonal connection. However, those with this understanding often still engage in self-harm to experience a lower pleasure at the expense of happiness. Therefore, happiness is not the ultimate goal of all human activities.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Another potential objection to my argument is that someone who engages in self-harm becomes trapped in a cycle of addiction, which prevents self-harm from being a deliberate choice. Happiness can still be the ultimate goal of deliberately chosen activities, as Aristotle implies when he states that “every deliberate choice reaches after some good” (Aristotle 579). However, one does make a deliberate choice to engage in self-harm, even in an addictive cycle. This is demonstrated by the fact that some people deliberately withdraw from cycles of self-harm. If one can choose to stop an action in the presence of addiction, one can also choose to continue an action in the same state. Thus, happiness is not the ultimate goal of all human activities.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Even if happiness is not the ultimate goal of all human activities, it might be the ultimate goal of human activities that are informed by reason. But Aristotle is incorrect in holding that one must reason to be happy. Aristotle himself explains that “no one counts someone happy who has suffered strokes of [bad luck] and dies in a wretched way” (Aristotle 584). On this view, luck is not enough to attain happiness, since bad luck can reverse good fortune. Using the same logic, reason is not enough to attain happiness either, since bad luck can destroy one’s efforts toward fulfillment. Consider someone who has practiced the virtues throughout their life but is ultimately diagnosed with terminal cancer. To Aristotle, this person would not be happy, so reason is not sufficient to attain happiness.</p>
    <br>
    <p>One might respond that even if reason is not a sufficient condition for happiness, it is nonetheless a necessary condition for happiness. For example, one may be lucky enough not to be born with a particular disability that impairs one’s capacity for reason. But one could still choose things contrary to one’s reason, like smoking cigarettes, that would hinder one’s ability to attain happiness. Thus, one needs reason to avoid vice and instead practice the virtues, so reason is required for attaining happiness. However, people with impaired capacities for reason can nonetheless be happy. Consider a person with a cognitive disability who trains for and wins an event in the Special Olympics. Many would agree that the joy this person experiences at such a feat signifies happiness, even though Aristotle would hold that their inability to reason sufficiently prevents them from reaching fulfillment. Aristotle’s conception of happiness neglects to consider that fulfillment can be relative to one’s own experiences. Therefore, reason is not necessary for happiness.</p>
    <br>
    <p>A potential objection is that happiness does require reason because reason is the proper function or unique characteristic of a human being. Thus, all human beings are potentially rational, and their capacity for rationality must be actualized for them to be fulfilled. Aristotle makes clear that non-human animals cannot attain happiness because they lack reason. For example, he writes that “while some beasts have imagination, none has reason” (Aristotle 523). But scientific discoveries reveal that multiple non-human animals, including elephants and chimpanzees, engage in rational decision-making. Reason does not make human beings distinct from non-human animals. Therefore, reason is not the proper function of a human being, so happiness does not require it.</p>
    <br>
    <p>One might further object that even if reason is not the proper function of a human being, it is still the purpose of a human being to be rational. However, natural selection explains that what appears to be a purpose is simply what was not selected against. Even though Aristotle claims in his Physics that front teeth are sharp for the purpose of biting, natural selection explains that front teeth tend to be sharp because genes for dull teeth did not get passed on as frequently. Similarly, humans tend to have the capacity for reason not because it is their intrinsic purpose to be rational but because reason historically facilitated social interactions that promoted survival. Thus, reason is not the purpose of a human being, so it is not required for happiness.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In addition, Aristotle incorrectly holds that happiness is something beyond pleasure, but happiness is pleasure. Consider asking a college student why they want to graduate. The student will likely say that they want to get a good job. When asked why they want to get a good job, they will likely say that they want to live a comfortable life. When asked why they want to live a comfortable life, they will likely say that they want to be happy. But happiness is merely the summation of pleasures from graduating, getting a good job, and living a comfortable life. Thus, happiness is pleasure.</p>
    <br>
    <p>One might object that we can become slaves to our pleasures but not to happiness, so pleasure is not happiness. For example, someone may become dependent on smoking cigarettes for pleasure, which can cause lasting lung damage and hamper one’s ability to live a fulfilling life. Socrates would describe this as “the tyranny of Passion” that someone who chases pleasure will encounter (Plato 389). But I respond that someone might similarly become obsessed with trying to live a fulfilling life. For example, one might become enslaved to happiness by studying endlessly in an attempt to obtain a dream job. Thus, happiness is pleasure.</p>
    <br>
    <p>A potential objection is that obsessing over happiness cannot bring happiness, since enslaving oneself to the goal of happiness is contrary to attaining happiness itself. Therefore, happiness is not pleasure. But John Stuart Mill would add that enslavement can only bring about lower pleasures. For example, an obsession with eating sugary foods can bring satisfaction until one gets a stomachache or diabetes. It cannot bring about higher pleasures, which involve lasting satisfaction rather than fleeting contentment. By Mill’s description, happiness is a higher pleasure, so happiness is pleasure.</p>
    <br>
    <p>One might further object that pleasure and happiness have different physiological foundations, so happiness is not pleasure. Pleasure is linked to dopamine, while happiness is linked to serotonin. But these scientific distinctions actually align with Mill’s description of lower and higher pleasures. Dopamine relates to short-term satisfaction. For example, it is often released when people receive “likes” on social media, which do not bring long-term contentment but instead signal lower pleasures. However, serotonin relates to long-term satisfaction or higher pleasures. For example, it is released during exercise, which facilitates one’s health and promotes happiness. Therefore, happiness is a higher pleasure, not something beyond pleasure.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I have described Aristotle’s understanding of happiness. I have argued that Aristotle’s understanding of happiness is incorrect. I have considered all objections to my argument and successfully refuted them. Therefore, I can conclude that Aristotle’s argument is not sound. First, Aristotle’s argument wrongly rests on the claim that happiness is the ultimate goal of all human activities, since Aristotle fails to consider cases in which temporary pleasure is the ultimate goal. Second, Aristotle incorrectly holds that reason is required for happiness, since he mistakenly identifies reason as the proper function of a human being. Finally, Aristotle falsely understands happiness as something beyond pleasure, when happiness is really a higher pleasure as Mill describes. My argument did not successfully prove that happiness is not the highest good. However, it did show that Aristotle’s understanding of happiness is incorrect, which prevents Aristotle from successfully identifying happiness as the highest good.</p>
