    <h3>A Politics of Friendship</h3>
    <h5>March 8th, 2022</h5>
  </div>
  <div class="main">
    <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>For one of the most common words in the English language, friendship is excruciatingly difficult to define. Psychologists Mahzad Hojjat and Anne Moyer identify five of its typical-ideal characteristics. According to their research, friendship is voluntary, personal, affective, mutual, and tending toward equality. It “has manifold psychological significance and time-honored recognition as indispensable for individual and communal well-being.” For this reason, “…it is imperative to investigate the continually emerging practices, experiences, forms, and functions of friendship” (Hojjat and Moyer). Throughout this paper, I will propose a little-researched function of friendship: guiding the complex dynamics that exist between institutions of higher education and their students, professors, and larger communities. I will argue that Washington and Lee University has specific obligations to its students and the Rockbridge Area in which it is situated, highlighting a politics of friendship as a necessary means of governing and continually reinforming these obligations.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Social and Economic Considerations</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>Eric Klinenberg aptly describes how no part of education is apolitical. Institutions of higher education exist as communities within communities, and who has access to these smaller communities involves inherently political questions of power and privilege (Klinenberg 89). Originally, higher education stood as a social institution. It worked to foster the public good both socially and economically by challenging society and seeking communal change (Saltmarsh et al. 13). Washington and Lee’s strategic plan still embodies these goals. The plan explicitly states that “W&L strives to make a positive difference in Lexington, Rockbridge County, and beyond” and highlights the university’s “commitment to institutional citizenship for the benefit of society” (“Strategic Plan”). However, higher education as a whole has lost its civically minded drive as it has evolved into a mechanism to produce <em>individual</em> social and economic success (Saltmarsh et al. 13). At Washington and Lee specifically, over seventy percent of students belong to on-campus Greek organizations, which host exclusive social opportunities and advertise the prestigious networking prospects associated with Greek membership (“Frequently Asked Questions About Greek Life”). They “encourage members to anchor their lives around them” and “avoid the diversity and difference a university offers” (Klinenberg 91). There seems to be a discrepancy between the percentage of students involved in Greek life and the proportion that regularly volunteers with on-campus or local service organizations; I find it interesting that I cannot find specific information regarding the latter statistic. Such a discrepancy emphasizes the prevailing culture in higher education that encourages the support of one’s students first and foremost, perhaps because students expect that colleges and universities principally promote their individual success. But the political nature and history of higher education demand that Washington and Lee engage socially and economically not merely within its own institution but within the Rockbridge region.</p>
    <br>
    <p>A politics of friendship would best clarify and facilitate these obligations. Washington and Lee must understand that while certain responsibilities regarding Rockbridge are obligatory, its friendship with Rockbridge is voluntary, meaning that it is not a given that these two communities become comrades. Thus, while Rockbridge invites Washington and Lee students and employees downtown for service opportunities, events, and more, the university must make a more concerted effort to engage in friendship with Rockbridge by reducing barriers to on-campus involvement. Presently, there are signs around campus stating that areas like the Dining Hall are open to members of the Rockbridge community. But the campus dining page on Washington and Lee’s website does not state this information, implying that Rockbridge residents must first navigate Washington and Lee’s campus even to know that they are allowed inside certain facilities (“Campus Dining Venues and Menus”). However, better advertising alone would not address the voluntary nature of friendship. The same is true of adding amenities to campus. Benches and open space on the Colonnade, for example, are important elements of public design, yet it is extremely rare to find anyone other than a Washington and Lee student utilizing these spaces. Rather than merely welcoming residents of Rockbridge, the university must actively invite them. It must embody the personal and affective components of friendship, expressing care for the larger community by considering the ways in which students, university employees, and other community members can more intentionally engage in shared social activities on campus. The Campus Kitchen Souperbowl event is a promising example. Though altered this year due to the pandemic, the fundraiser normally brings people together from throughout Washington and Lee and the larger Rockbridge area to enjoy an assortment of soups in Evans Hall. Perhaps other on-campus events that specifically invite Rockbridge residents could inspire and sustain a voluntary, personal, and affective friendship between the university and the greater community.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Washington and Lee must also emphasize the mutual component of friendship. Hojjat and Moyer state, “As a free-standing bond, friendship is inherently relational; it is accomplished and sustained communicatively and through shared activities demonstrating each person’s regard for the other.” In regards to the Souperbowl example, the Campus Kitchen expresses mutuality in its relationship with the Rockbridge area. It begins the event design process with empathy, considering its own fundraising goals alongside the desires of the student body and larger community. Like Etienne, it raises the “for whom” question, deciding the pricing of its soups in a way that balances its monetary goals with the resources of those who reside on and off campus (6). To better express its care for Rockbridge, the Campus Kitchen could invite community members to help decide the details of the event in non-pandemic years. Perhaps assigned seating would best promote opportunities for Rockbridge residents to interact with Washington and Lee students, who may otherwise segregate into predetermined, on-campus groups.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In addition to mutuality, it is critical that Washington and Lee tend toward equality in determining and fulfilling its obligations within the Rockbridge area. As Hojjat and Moyer describe, “[B]eginning in childhood, participating in friendship is a site for ethical instruction, for cultivating understandings of fairness and cooperation. And throughout our lives issues of equality and power must be settled between friends.” Just as I would not consider someone to be a friend who acts on what <em>they</em> rather than <em>I</em> determine to be my needs, it is not likely that Washington and Lee and the Rockbridge community could engage in meaningful friendship if the university seeks to “[provide] ‘solutions’ to what has been determined to be the community’s ‘needs’” (Saltmarsh et al. 7). Rather, Washington and Lee as an institution must practice democratic engagement, actively acknowledging the mutuality involved in knowledge creation. It must seek to address community needs not for but with Rockbridge (Saltmarsh et al. 11). For example, rather than only “involving analysts from institutional research in completing a community needs assessment,” it must strive to invite and listen to community voices through cooperation with entities like Community Development Corporations (Mitchell 57). As Etienne describes, such involvement proved key in Northeastern University’s efforts to build more student housing without “aggressively and covertly acquiring property adjacent to its campus” (100-101). As Washington and Lee seeks to expand its physical property, an approach similar to that of Northeastern would embody a politics of friendship that seeks to promote mutuality and tend toward equality with the Rockbridge area (“W&L Revising Master Plan”). Finally, though philanthropic initiatives may seem beneficial—for instance, Washington and Lee giving the money that it as a non-profit saves on property taxes to groups in Rockbridge—these initiatives must be evaluated through the lens of mutuality and equality to substantiate friendship.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Respectful and Responsible Engagement</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>Scholar Eve Tuck warns of the potential for attempts at inclusion to instrumentalize the pain of community members. In her view, the predominant theory of change testifies to damage, which flattens individuals and communities by documenting their deficit without posing desire-driven opportunities to address existing inequalities (Tuck 413). Tuck’s warning maps nicely onto the politics of friendship. Friends do not ask one another solely to share their pain. They also desire to know about one another’s hopes and longings, to see each other’s multidimensionality, not just one-dimensional labels. Washington and Lee could best embody this idea by refusing to ask Rockbridge residents exclusively about their needs. For example, the university could aspire to cultivate dreaming of what a just, healthy community looks like by inviting community members to participate in institutional strategic planning. Instead of streamlining studies or coursework by focusing on who they identify as damaged, research students and professors at Washington and Lee could also broaden the scope of their inquiries beyond those centered on deficit. They could seek different sources of imagination to explore communities in their wholeness through revisions in research questions or curricula, for instance. It is important to acknowledge that this approach likely demands not only more resources than the damage-centered method but also requires that students and professors alike be willing to abandon the cult of expertise (Saltmarsh et al. 10). They must subvert long-held expectations about power while surrendering a part of their own.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Educational Considerations</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>Although a deficit-based structure of harm cannot feasibly be dismantled at once, Washington and Lee can educate its students in ways that deconstruct static conceptions of power and deep-seated patterns of oppression. As an institution, the university has a responsibility to uphold its mission statement in which it promises to cultivate students' abilities to “think freely, critically, and humanely” (“Mission and Vision”). Washington and Lee acknowledges the power of education, stating in its strategic plan, “We achieve our largest social impact [locally and globally] through the education of our students.” Its plan also highlights its goal to “[embrace] the 21st-century evolution of liberal education, which involves interdisciplinary inquiry, new modes of teaching, and rapidly changing technology” (“Strategic Plan”). A politics of friendship highlights the need for new modes of teaching most specifically. Today, institutions of higher education tend to uphold firm distinctions between students and professors. Such a tendency supports hierarchies of knowledge, making it commonplace for students to mimic “asymmetrical and static power relations” when they engage in the larger community (Mitchell 56). While traditional service-learning emphasizes the outcomes of students over those of the local area, Tania Mitchell’s notion of critical service-learning suggests a more equitable relationship. In decentering labels of “student” and “professor,” for example, it inspires friendship, inviting students and professors to enter into voluntary, personal, affective, and mutual connections that tend toward equality rather than firm hierarchy (Mitchell 57).</p>
    <br>
    <p>Numerous approaches to critical as opposed to traditional service-learning can destabilize common conceptions of power, encouraging friendship in the process (Mitchell 52). For instance, a focus on human-centered design can redistribute power through changes in classroom layout or location. Rigid arrangements that center professors at the front of the classroom can shift toward more flexible, circular orientations of desks and chairs. As Mitchell suggests, classes can even be held in different environments—lounges, outdoor spaces, or spots like local community offices or libraries—to demonstrate that learning can occur in locations other than the classroom (58). Overall, these changes in physical space can prompt changes in mental space, allowing students and professors alike to challenge traditional roles by engaging in authentic friendships with one another. As Mrs. Kay Cottle, a teacher whom sociologist Sara Lawrence-Lightfoot describes, shares, “I want to show my respect for [my students] as peers. I want to treat them as friends” (109). Mrs. Cottle accomplishes this by practicing vulnerability with her students, daringly choosing to open herself up to them by sharing parts of her life, which encourages her students to risk delving wholly into their education with her as their teacher and friend (Lawrence-Lightfoot 115). By growing in friendships through reciprocal vulnerability, professors can educate students to approach service-learning experiences through the lens of friendship. Professors at Washington and Lee specifically can teach students how to cultivate care for the Rockbridge area by personally caring for their students. Their acts of friendship can demonstrate an exploration not simply of what they themselves can contribute within the classroom environment but what students can bring forth. Similarly, they can prompt students not only to discover what they can provide within the Rockbridge community but what the community itself has to offer.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>As a politics of friendship highlights, individuals and institutions share responsibilities in pursuing relations of friendship with their larger communities. Yet attempts at realizing such friendships highlight various points of tension. Related to the resource constraints that I mentioned above, friendship is consistently demanding. Washington and Lee must find a balance between identifying and addressing its constituents’ wants and needs and the wants and needs of the Rockbridge area. For example, it must consider how best to implement changes in curricula that highlight a desire-centered approach, uplifting the genuine hopes of Rockbridge while not neglecting the hopes of its own students and faculty. While the university encourages dreaming in the Rockbridge community, its students and professors must try to discern the origin and destination of their own dreams. They must ask themselves why they want the futures that they desire and how those futures can blend in friendship with one another and the imaginings of those in the Rockbridge area. This notion of dream-blending may sound overly idealistic, but as Palmer shares, idealism need not be a naïve hope. We can hold our longing in tension with what we know about the barriers to ideal community (Palmer 26). In the process, we must commit ourselves communally, institutionally, and individually to growing in friendship. We must strive to embrace the conflict that we experience with our closest comrades, the tension that is consistently challenging but never devoid of beautiful dreams.</p>
