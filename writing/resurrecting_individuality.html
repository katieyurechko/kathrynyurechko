    <h3>Resurrecting Individuality</h3>
    <h5>March 18th, 2022</h5>
  </div>
  <div class="main">
    <p>Political philosopher Raymond Geuss defines what he terms the “Platonist’s Blackmail.” According to the blackmail, having orientation in the world must mean having a single systematic theory that provides one with a certain way of proceeding in all situations. Without a totalizing doctrine, the blackmail states, one has no choice but to live “at random” with no orientation at all (Geuss 60-61). Geuss argues that this view is naïve, constraining, and anxiety-producing, and in Ralph Ellison’s <em>Invisible Man</em>, readers witness the unnamed narrator navigate these realities. They observe his development as he attends but ultimately leaves a college that is emblematic of the Platonist’s mindset. By painting the college’s leaders as a powerful trinity, depicting the narrator’s disillusionment with their system of belief, and portraying a turning point in the narrator’s development as a resurrection or rebirth, Ellison highlights the role of totalizing doctrines in cementing a suppressed, fixed identity and the role of confronting the failures of such doctrines in fostering a more liberated, fluid identity.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The foremost member of the trinity that Ellison describes is the Founder of the college, whom readers first come to know when the narrator recalls his statue. The firm monument depicts the Founder as a “cold Father symbol” with “hands outstretched in the breathtaking gesture of lifting a veil that flutters in hard, metallic folds above the face of a kneeling slave” (Ellison 36). The capitalized “F” in Father suggests that the Founder is god-like; when the narrator visits the college chapel, the reverend’s sermon explicitly describes him as a “godly man.” But the reverend soon refers to the Founder as a “living parable,” a story commonly defined as one told by Jesus Christ, thus suggesting that the Founder is not only god-like but a sort of God himself. As the reverend continues to preach, he emphasizes the omnipotence of the Founder, yet his diction alludes to the subduing impact of that omnipotence on others. He details the Founder’s vision of inclusive higher education, “fulfilled now even in the air [the students] breathe, in the sweet harmonies of [their] blended voices” (120). Though the “sweet harmonies” that he mentions may seem free-flowing, the reverend references the Founder’s practice of “instilling” his dream in others and “instructing…the spellbound rows caught in the imperious truth of his message” to accept it (124-125). The reverend redescribes the “sweet harmonies” as a “deep-felt song,” one that does not flow freely but overwhelms the depths of one’s being (123). It seems that instead of either “a revelation or a more efficient blinding” taking place as the sculpted Founder lifts the veil for the slave, both results occur at once: the Founder unveils his greatness to the slave, effectively shielding the slave to his or her own potential for uniqueness (36). The Founder ultimately provides a model for the slave to emulate, much like the slave in the Founder’s statue serves as a guide for the Founder’s slave-like adherents. They must strive to uphold the cemented beliefs that the statue signifies, allowing their personhood to remain frozen in time like the identities of the Founder and the slave themselves.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Ellison portrays the college’s president, Dr. Bledsoe, and a trustee named Mr. Norton as two who follow authoritatively in the footsteps of the Founder. When the reverend recalls the Founder’s death, he describes how Dr. Bledsoe’s voice rang out “whip-like with authority, a song of hope” (125). Though a “song of hope” may sound liberating, the mention of an instrument used to punish and assert dominance suggests that Dr. Bledsoe’s authority is hopeful precisely because it is “whip-like.” It is capable of cementing students into fixed, subservient beings who blindly align with the Founder’s vision. The reverend additionally remembers hearing Dr. Bledsoe “[command] not in words but in the great gut-tones of his magnificent basso” (125). He recalls Dr. Bledsoe speaking to an audience of adherents with his hands outstretched “as though he were leading an orchestra into a profound and final diminuendo” (127). These lines make clear that Dr. Bledsoe’s musical skills direct his followers into silent adherence. The magnificence of his voice lies specifically in its power to overpower others. The reverend finally describes Dr. Bledsoe’s strict allegiance to the Founder. Preaching to the audience, he says, “[P]attern yourselves upon [Dr. Bledsoe]. Aspire, each of you, to some day follow in his footsteps,” thus encouraging the students to solidify themselves into Dr. Bledsoe’s and ultimately the Founder’s mold (133). To complete the trinity that he portrays, Ellison depicts Mr. Norton as a force comparable to that of the Founder. The narrator aims to please Mr. Norton by fulfilling his every desire, even bringing him to a sinful Golden Day event to procure a drink that he requests. At the scene, a wise veteran tells Mr. Norton that he is not a man to the narrator. Instead, he is “a God, a force,” and the narrator is “the most perfect achievement of [Mr. Norton’s] dreams” since he has “learned to repress not only his emotions but his humanity” (94-95). The narrator serves as evidence of the absolute power of the trinity, for in “shunning all but the straight and narrow path that [Mr. Norton] and the Founder had stretched,” he experiences the suppression of his individuality (99). He remains “bound to a great dream and to a beautiful monument,” worshipping a statue representative of the vision that chains him to a fixed identity (43).</p>
    <br>
    <p>The narrator venerates the trinity’s vision until he begins to recognize its flaws. As he awaits his judgement for bringing Mr. Norton to Golden Day, he sees a portrait of the Founder look down upon him “disillusioned.” Ellison immediately notes that “a veil seemed to fall,” suggesting that the narrator, no longer synonymous with the slave in the monument, starts to awaken to his own potential for uniqueness (103). The veil is not removed by the Founder but by its own fall, thus symbolizing the narrator’s nascent disillusionment with the Founder’s vision. Readers witness this phenomenon when a member of the powerful three expels the narrator from college. Dr. Bledsoe brings the narrator to grapple with his unflinching faith in the trinity, causing him to think to himself, “I had believed without question [Dr. Bledsoe’s] illustrations of the good which came of following the Founder’s path. It was my affirmation of life and they simply couldn’t send me away for something I didn’t do” (106). Yet the narrator continues to follow the Founder’s path, accepting Dr. Bledsoe’s demand that he attend chapel the following day. He continues to bear a rigid identity at the service, “finding that [seat] to which [he was] assigned and bending [his] body to its agony” (110). The pews symbolize the trinity’s inflexibility in its vision, with the chapel as a whole exemplifying that vision’s identity-fixing effects. A choir member further conveys this point, singing as though her own voice “had become the source of her being, rather than the fluid web of her own creation” (116). She is dictated by her vocals rather than dictating them herself, which causes her to gain approval from white guests who dedicate themselves to the Founder’s dream. The singer ultimately embodies the slave in the statue, allowing her unique voice to become “a disembodied force that sought to enter her, to violate her” instead of an entity capable of expressing itself freely in flowing song.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The disillusionment of the narrator continues as Ellison elaborates upon his experience at the chapel. For the first time, the narrator finds praise of the Founder to be disquieting. Audience members continue to “shake their spellbound heads” at the reverend’s sermon, but the narrator feels his grounding identity begin to slip away “like the fading of a dream at the sundering of slumber” (123). This “dream” is likely the Founder’s vision from which the narrator wakes, especially as he decides to flee the service that Dr. Bledsoe commanded him to attend. By retreating, the narrator expresses individual thought rather than strict allegiance to a structure of belief. His flight from the chapel’s rigidity mirrors the flight of a mockingbird, which the narrator hears “[trill] a note from where it perched upon the hand of the moonlit Founder.” The bird “[flips] its moon-mad tail above the head of the eternally kneeling slave,” as if prompting the narrator and other slave-like adherents of the Founder’s vision to trill their own notes of defiance (134). When he prepares to leave the college, the narrator sees “a whirling, double-imaged moon.” He begins to empathize with the “moon-mad” attitude of the mockingbird as he struggles with the contradictory elements of the trinity’s vision. He questions, “How had I come to this? I had kept unswervingly to the path placed before me, had tried to be exactly what I was expected to be, had done exactly what I was expected to do” (146). He strives to understand the contradiction that he finds in the vision’s promise of a fixed destination for those who follow it and its denial of that destination to him, a believer who strictly travelled the trinity’s path. Once he is forced to leave, the narrator wishes to return to the college, but he soon learns that Dr. Bledsoe’s plan does not wish the same for him. The narrator’s expulsion is final, which prompts him to insist that he “always tried to do the right thing” (191). Though he begins to break free from the trinity’s emphasis on a fixed self and a fixed path, he remains enmeshed in the idea that there is only one “right thing” to do.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The narrator continues to wrestle with the Founder’s plan until a dramatic explosion lands him in the hospital. Symbolic of the shattering of the narrator’s firm belief in the trinity, the explosion represents an incendiary break from his fixed identity. Earlier in the novel, the vet from Golden Day advises the narrator, “Be your own father, young man” (156). Considering Ellison’s descriptions of the Founder as a father, the vet might mean that the narrator should raise himself and choose his own trajectory in life. The powerful religious connotations of the Founder additionally suggest that the vet advises the narrator to be his own God, to claim authority over his own fate like the Founder did with his adherents’ destinies. In the hospital, the narrator begins to fulfill the vet’s prophesy by undergoing a god-like transformation. Similar to the Founder, “You might say that it was as though he had risen from the dead or been reborn” (119). The narrator finds himself lying in a box, “the lid of which was propped open,” which suggests that he resurrects like Jesus himself from the death-like state of suppressed individuality. He also describes what it feels like to wake after the explosion, stating that it is “as though [he] had just begun to live” (233). Unable to remember his mother’s name and without parents by his side, the narrator seems to become his own father as the vet recommends. The musical struggle that the narrator endures suggests that this process gives rise to a more fluid identity. He repeatedly hears “three short and one long buzz” of classical music, “struggling and breaking through” (232). But later in the scene, he recognizes “the mocking obligato of a mocking bird” above all other sounds (234). The sense of defiance brews again, except it is more than a trill; the mockingbird sings a melody that is usually played by a single instrument, which signals the ascendance of the narrator’s individuality over his prior adherence to traditional music. His identity begins to synchronize with the fluidity of the mockingbird’s song.</p>
    <br>
    <p>After the narrator leaves the hospital, Ellison describes the beginning of his journey as his own God. The narrator begins to create himself in his own image, claiming, “I was no longer afraid. Not of important men, not of trustees and such; for knowing now that there was nothing which I could expect from them, there was no reason to be afraid” (249). With his hope in the Founder’s vision shattered by the explosion, the narrator no longer fears the trinity and those with whom its authority is associated. He ceases to describe Dr. Bledsoe in reference to his collegian peers as a “coal-black daddy of whom [they] were afraid” (116). Rather, he states, “I became afraid of what I might do” (260). He grapples not with the promises that his previous path failed to keep but with the plurality of identities floating around within him, wishing, “If only all the contradictory voices shouting inside my head would calm down and sing a song in unison.” The narrator craves a calming of the internal chaos that his more fluid identity brings. However, it is clear that his resurrection or rebirth initiates a fundamental change in his perspective. Instead of asking, “How could I ever return home?” he shares, “All things were indeed awash in my mind. I longed for home” (260). This transition demonstrates that the newfound flexibility of the narrator’s identity brings him discomfort, but the stability for which he longs is not rooted in a firm destination. The home that he desires is not fixed but fluid; he no longer hopes to return to a set path but to shape his own. In this sense, the narrator begins to act as his personal higher power, aspiring to make his own destiny rather than let the trinity dictate it for him.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The narrator’s journey illustrates the naivety, self-limitation, and anxiety that can accompany one’s adherence to a totalizing doctrine (Geuss 61). It illuminates Geuss’s argument about the Platonist’s Blackmail and offers hope as the narrator continues on his journey home. Previously suspended in the illusion that his unflinching devotion to the trinity would bring him final contentment, the narrator demonstrates growth out of a fixed role and into his own God. Rather than becoming entombed in a totalizing doctrine, he resurrects to wrestle with the discomfort that accompanies his newfound freedom. He proceeds on his journey, not yet fully understanding or embracing Geuss’s closing remark, that regardless of whether one has a totalizing doctrine by which to structure one’s existence, “no one is born with the promise of a comfortable life” (Geuss 63).</p>
