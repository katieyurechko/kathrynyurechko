    <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>It is undeniable that a strong notion of community-building is tied to social media, which poses significant possibilities for enhancing our interpersonal connections and promoting a healthier, more just, and more beautiful civic life. However, in the past decade, a series of questions has arisen in response to these hopes. First, what impact does the regular use of social media have on the development of an individual’s identity? As users increasingly share snapshots of their stories, we must analyze the potentially static selves and similarly fixed perspectives of others that can arise within digital environments. Second, since social media corporations have tended to pride themselves on promoting inclusivity and diversity, one must ask: who has been algorithmically and institutionally marginalized from these forms of participation? Third, are many—let alone most—individuals in the 21st century really motivated to “engage” in the world and their communities through these platforms, or is this a hangover fantasy of their inception? Fourth and finally, we must consider the fundamental connections between individuals, institutions, and communities. Through the lens of “friending,” we can strive to answer the question, how can we best navigate the complexities of community and civic life in a digital era? I propose the creation of an FDR entitled “Community in a Digital Age” to examine these issues. Composed of four core classes, its trajectory is designed to get students to think critically and <em>collectively</em> about where the civic life stands, its major technological impediments, and its potential future. The thoughtful engagement of the four questions above constitutes the FDR’s learning outcomes.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Rethinking Roles: Destabilizing Digitized Identities in a Fluid Technological World</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>The first course in the FDR focuses on the role of individuals. It invites students to engage critically with their identities, specifically through an exploration of their own stories and the means through which they are shared. This course has three main learning outcomes. First, students will investigate the role of social media in cementing fixed identities. A key reading to accompany this exploration will be “How Social Media Shapes our Identity” by Nausicaa Renner. Throughout the term, students will maintain a journal of what they consider to be their individual stories. They will read each entry alongside their social media profiles, attempting to recognize any disparities between the way that they see themselves and the way that they choose to be portrayed. Students will analyze not only how likes and comments (or the lack thereof) might narrow their sense of self but how they may allow the images and captions of others to solidify their perspectives. Second, students will develop an understanding of damage- as opposed to desire-centered research. They will consider pictures and stories that they find when scrolling through social media feeds to frame how deficit can singularly define a community (Tuck 413). In groups, they will brainstorm ways in which they can resist the drive toward single-faceted narratives of damage. Like Dawoud Bey, a photographer whom Sara Lawrence-Lightfoot describes in her novel <em>Respect: An Exploration</em>, they will develop ideas for cultivating a “view that resists caricature” (Lawrence-Lightfoot 151). Finally, students will “zoom out” to examine the ideologies/structures that solidify a one-dimensional perspective on individuals. They will analyze the role of neoliberalism in promoting an idea of human beings as human capital and how such a view further marginalizes oppressed communities who are seen as having no valuable products to offer. A central reading to guide their examination will be a chapter of Wendy Brown’s <em>Undoing the Demos: Neoliberalism’s Stealth Revolution</em> entitled “Educating Human Capital,” which will prompt the consideration of a significant trend: university-level students seeing themselves as units of productivity rather than human beings who are in a constant state of growth and becoming.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>The Automation of Power and Privilege: An Institutional Analysis of Social Media Corporations</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>Once students investigate their own potential to interrupt cycles of one-dimensionality and damage, the second course in the FDR will encourage them to further their exploration of structures. They will analyze social media corporations as invisible institutions, ultimately considering their effects on those whose stories have been disproportionately silenced or left unheard. This course has three main learning outcomes. First, students will learn about the algorithms that operate behind their screens. They will read about the emotionally manipulative and addictive power of social media patterns in addition to the concept of algorithmic bias. The novel <em>Algorithms of Oppression</em> by Safiya Noble will aid them in their exploration, helping them to determine what obligations, if any, social media corporations have in promoting equitable engagement. The Beata Biały piece entitled “Social Media—From Social Exchange to Battlefield,” which depicts the weaponization of information against targeted groups, will further elucidate any obligations that rest with social media companies. Second, students will investigate the phenomenon of civic habitus, defined as “the tacit, rational collusion with socialised norms of power in order to survive and evade harm” (Pettit 1). They will continue to develop their ideas regarding the marginalization of already-oppressed communities online then turn the lens inward to contemplate their own potentially habitual compliance with digital structures of power and privilege (Pettit 4). The reading “Why Citizens Don’t Engage – Power, Poverty and Civic Habitus” by Jethro Pettit will provide students with useful vocabularies for framing these investigations. Finally, students will assess a prevailing claim of proponents of social media, that “better access to information and knowledge will produce citizen engagement” (Pettit 7). They will grapple with the power dynamics that exist between social media corporations and their constituents, especially in light of the algorithms that promote tailored viewing suggestions for every individual. They will consider Parker Palmer’s probing claim: “If we fail to turn inward for some of our news, we cannot embrace the questions…on which democracy depends—questions about our inner capacity for mutual respect, generosity, listening openly to others, courage, trust, and resolve” (Palmer 157).</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>(Anti)social Media: The Perils and Promises of Online Engagement</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>After thinking deeply about the roles of individuals and social media corporations, the third course in the FDR will encourage students to question the “social” element of social media. It has four main learning outcomes. First, students will expand upon their understandings of what it means to engage respectfully both within and outside of the virtual world. They will critically assess acts of respect/disrespect by journaling about virtual and physical behaviors that they observe in their daily lives. Second, students will conduct a thorough investigation of the term engagement itself, aided by UNICEF’s report entitled “Digital Civic Engagement by Young People.” They will reevaluate their own online interactions and consider whether encountering “otherness” in the realm of social media increases their desire to engage in their communities with respect. Third, students will investigate the power of social media engagement to generate beneficial change. The paper “Social Networks, Social Media, Social Change” written by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University will introduce students to instances in which the use of digital platforms tangibly ignited social progress, allowing them to contemplate the benefits and potential limitations of changemaking that originates online. Lastly, students will synthesize their understandings of the promises and shortcomings of online engagement to build social capital within their community. Rather than simply liking posts in support of those experiencing poverty and inequality, students will collaborate with community members to host an in-person social gathering centered around these issues. They will employ what they have learned about respectful engagement by joining with others to promote a more deliberative and dynamic civic life, fundamentally considering the ways in which various mediums can be utilized to enact change amidst the wonders and challenges associated with online and offline engagement.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Friendship: The Phenomenon of “Friending” in Digital and Physical Communities</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>After students develop a deeper understanding of what it means to engage in community, the final course in the FDR will support them in (re)evaluating their conceptions of friendship. The central reading for this course will be <em>The Psychology of Friendship</em> by Mahzad Hojjat and Anne Moyer. As its description states, the book “serves as a field guide for readers as they shed traditional definitions of friendship in favor of contemporary contexts and connections,” especially in light of “the meteoric rise of countless social media platforms.” The course has five main learning outcomes. First, students will reflect on the ways in which individuals become friends. They will write about personal experiences of entering into friendships and investigate the circumstances that lead to the blossoming of such relations. Second, students will consider what constitutes genuine friendship and what friendship looks like in the world of social media. When “friending” can be a simple one-way engagement like “following” rather than a more demanding and symmetric commitment, students will discuss what platform design choices enhance or challenge their perspectives on what it means to be a friend. The article “Social Media and Relationships: Who Is Actually a Friend?” by Tammy Kahn Fennell will help them navigate this discussion. Third, students will contemplate the ways in which isolated profiles, the potential for anonymity, and the concept of “blocking” can strengthen preferences for the private life. They will reflect on their own online patterns and how they mirror or diverge from their tendencies in the physical world, considering the Palmer quote: “In the midst of contentious online dialogue between apparently irreconcilable viewpoints, I have sometimes found myself tempted to leave the room—even though I would not think of walking out if we were in a face-to-face debate” (Palmer 174). Fourth, students will engage critically with the idea of strangers and the ways in which the mantra “NO STRANGERS ALLOWED EXCEPT BY INVITATION” plays into their digital and physical lives (Palmer 91). They will consider the findings detailed in “Friendship, Strangers and Safety in Online Social Networks” by Amanda Lenhart and Mary Madden from the Pew Research Center, creating space to analyze the tendencies to blockade social media profiles from online predation, scams, and more that may exacerbate the tendency to isolate from strangers in the physical world. Finally, students will strive to be more present in the company of local “strangers.” They will largely disconnect from social media for the final weeks of the course, connecting face-to-face with community members through walks downtown, coffee shop conversations, and other ordinary activities.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>At the end of their FDR experience, students will gather to reflect on the individual and institutional promises and challenges of community engagement through the lens of friendship. They will be able to answer the question: What does having friends foster in our own lives, and what does it require of us? There will undoubtedly be difficulties involved in navigating and addressing the issues that students explore in this FDR, so a consistent emphasis on engaging with respect will highlight the fact that we cannot solve pressing injustices in four semester-long segments. However, students will leave their FDR experience with a better appreciation of their own power to make personal and communal change. They will be well-equipped to reflect both charitably and critically on the state of the civic life, as these courses will foster an enthusiasm for contemplating the landscape of our communities in a digital age.</p>
