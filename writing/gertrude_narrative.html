    <h3>Gertrude Narrative: To Choose, or Not to Have a Choice</h3>
    <h5>February 11th, 2019</h5>
  </div>
  <div class="main">
    <p>Claudius, with his handsome brow and rigid jaw. My husband, the renowned King Hamlet, wrinkling from the distress of war. Claudius, eyes so full of desire, giving me all of his attention, while the one I am supposed to love is focused, but not on me.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It is a dull life here in Elsinore. I wake up every morning to bring my dear husband his tea, then spend the entire day locked outside his royal chamber’s shut door. He sits behind it in silence and strife, preparing to battle his rival Fortinbras, King of Norway, while I anxiously await his company outside, and am never relieved. My son knows not how his father’s preoccupation affects my life here at the palace. He worships his father, and why should he not? Hamlet is a great King, after all. Just not a great husband.</p>
    <br>
    <p>For a long time, I try my hardest to accept my marriage as it is and conceal my deep yearning for something more. Women like me are expected to be prim and proper, to sit and wait patiently for our husbands to need us rather than make it known that we need them, and as Queen of the land, I am held most highly to these standards. Astutely aware of this, I choose to remain within the palace’s walls and wait for Hamlet to turn his attention back to me, but then I remember that he is both my husband and my King, after all, and the wellbeing of the nation comes forever before the happiness of his wife. With time, days full of waiting for the change you know will never come grow tiresome, so tiresome that when something or someone new arrives with the potential to liven up your life, you become mesmerized. It is hard to resist temptation when it comes knocking on your door, distracting you from the locked one your husband remains behind, and that is exactly why when my husband’s brother Claudius pays an unexpected visit to the palace, I warmly invite him in.</p>
    <br>
    <p>“Claudius,” I say, “it has been much too long!”</p>
    <br>
    <p>He looks at me with a mischievous gleam in his eye. “Why Gertrude,” he says, scanning me up and down, “don’t you look more beautiful than ever.” He takes a step closer.</p>
    <br>
    <p><em>More beautiful than ever</em>. The last time Hamlet paid enough attention to my appearance to compliment it must have been weeks or possibly even months ago! “Well,” I reply, “when your husband stays locked within his chamber all day, pacing up and down the stairs sure makes for some great exercise.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>Claudius gazes at me with a lustful grin. “How could any man ever ignore you?”</p>
    <br>
    <p>Suddenly, a voice disturbs our flirtatious exchange. Hamlet’s voice. “Why hello, brother,” he interjects in a blatantly suspicious tone. “What brings you here without even the slightest notice? Did the guards let you in?”</p>
    <br>
    <p>“Dear brother,” Claudius replies, “it seems as though my presence has perturbed you, so on that note, I must go.” At his brother’s assured departure, Hamlet retires once again to his chamber upstairs, allowing Claudius to turn and face me without my husband’s observation. Grasping a piece of notepaper in his strong and deliberate hand, Claudius whispers, “Until we meet again, most stunning Gertrude,” and smoothly slides the folded note into the sash of my gown. He moves toward the palace door, grinning that same seductive grin, then exits without another word.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I immediately open the note and read its tempting print: <em>Meet me in the garden tomorrow at noon - Claudius.</em></p>
    <br>
    <p>I feel my heart skip a beat. He wants me to meet him in the garden, the secluded and mysterious green far outside these bland palace walls. I know this is wrong. I am still married to Hamlet, and he is such a great king. But I need more, so I decide to meet Claudius.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The clock strikes twelve the following day as I anticipate Claudius’s arrival. The wait is so invigorating, unlike the endless moments I spend awaiting Hamlet’s company in the palace. I picture Claudius, handsome and brooding, encaptivating and sophisticated, and my heart picks up its pace. Back at the palace, I must always wear my hair in tightly-kept buns or taut and proper braids, but here in this garden, with no expectations to weigh on me, I let down my hair. I scatter the loose strands gently atop my shoulders and, for the first time in so long, I feel free. </p>
    <br>
    <p>At once Claudius appears near the garden’s entrance and begins making his way toward me, his eyes holding a dangerously compelling gaze. “Gertrude,” he says, approaching slowly, “I am so pleased you could meet me here.” He gestures for me to take a seat.</p>
    <br>
    <p>“Pleased, you say?” As I sit down next to him, blood begins to pulse rapidly through my veins, my heart quickens as it picks up its pace, and the buzzing thoughts in my mind mellow to a silence as I suddenly forget the palace, the waiting, the marriage I am supposed to honor.</p>
    <br>
    <p>“Yes, very pleased,” Claudius replies, but within moments, his face darkens. He becomes rather serious, solemn even. “You see, Gertrude, there is an important matter I must discuss with you.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>My heart beats faster than my mind can process my actions, and by some inner force, I am compelled to make the small space that separates myself from Claudius disappear. I slide close to him, then closer, my long locks cascading freely past my shoulders, as I whisper into his ear, “Why so serious, Claudius?” </p>
    <br>
    <p>He pulls away. “Gertrude, this <em>is</em> serious,” he insists, but I do not listen. I gently brush my fingers through his luscious hair and start to undo the knot in his tie. But he pulls away once more.</p>
    <br>
    <p>“Is something wrong?” I ask. All of a sudden, reality starts to seep back in as memories of life at the palace, of the vows I made to my husband, creep shamefully back into my mind. “This was a mistake,” I say.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The grave expression on Claudius’s face vanishes immediately. “You did nothing wrong, Gertrude. It’s just… it’s about King Hamlet.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>“He most definitely would not approve of this meeting,” I add. “Then again, he’s so preoccupied in the palace lately, he probably hasn’t even noticed I’m gone.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>Claudius interjects. “You see, Gertrude, I have feelings for you that I cannot conceal or deny, dangerous feelings. And the way I see it, your husband is standing in the way.” He reaches into his coat pocket and reveals a vile filled of thick, black fluid.</p>
    <br>
    <p><em>What is he holding?</em> I wonder. <em>Is that poison?</em> No, it most definitely cannot be! Have I gone mad?</p>
    <br>
    <p>But before I get the chance to say another word, Claudius bluntly informs me that the vile he holds contains a poison called henbane, which he specially acquired from a plant in this very garden. He plans to use it to murder Hamlet.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In a burst of confusion, I exclaim, “This cannot be so!” I feel myself suddenly repulsed by the man who, a mere few minutes earlier, encaptivated every ounce of my sexuality. Emotions of anger, fear, despair, regret rapidly well up inside me. I shout at Claudius, “I do not know why you called me here. You should know I would never betray my husband on such a grand scale. Now, leave me be! I refuse to be involved in this twisted plot of yours!”</p>
    <br>
    <p>But Claudius just looks at me, smiling that same sly grin of his, not an ounce of sympathy or remorse in his eyes. “Oh, my dear Gertrude,” he says. “You think you have a choice.”</p>
