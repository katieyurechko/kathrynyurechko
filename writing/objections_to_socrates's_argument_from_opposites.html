    <h3>Objections to Socrates’s Argument from Opposites</h3>
    <h5>October 1st, 2022</h5>
  </div>
  <div class="main">
    <p>In Plato’s <em>Phaedo</em>, Socrates presents his Argument from Opposites, which tries to prove that it is possible for a soul to be reborn. I will argue that Socrates’s Argument from Opposites is not sound. First, by citing passages in the text, I will explain Socrates’s argument. Second, I will show that his argument is invalid, then consider objections to my view and responses to those objections. Third, I will show that his argument has two false premises, then consider objections to my view and responses to those objections. Finally, I will conclude that Socrates’s argument violates both criteria for soundness.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Socrates establishes that particulars with an opposite “must necessarily come to be from their opposite and from nowhere else” (Plato 174). For example, something that is larger must have become larger from being smaller before (Plato 174). Socrates then claims that “being alive” and “being dead” are opposites. Therefore, he concludes that “they come to be from one another and there are two processes of generation between the two” (Plato 175). Knowing that dying is one of the processes, Socrates claims that if coming to life again can happen, then the other process would be “coming from the dead to the living” (Plato 175). Thus, Socrates concludes that it is possible for a soul to be reborn.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I will show that Socrates’s Argument from Opposites is invalid. Socrates claims that being alive and being dead are opposites, so they come from one another through two processes of generation. However, Socrates uses the word “opposite” in two different senses. In the first sense, “opposite” refers to contrasting qualities that vary in degree, including “larger” and “smaller,” “stronger” and “weaker,” and “swifter” and “slower” (Plato 174). But in the second sense, “opposite” refers to contrasting qualities that do not vary in degree, including “being alive” and “being dead” (Plato 175). Something can only be alive or dead. It cannot be aliver or deader. Socrates’s Argument from Opposites thus rests on an equivocation of the word “opposite.” Therefore, his argument is invalid because it relies on a logical fallacy.</p>
    <br>
    <p>One potential objection comes when Socrates describes purification. He states that purification is “to separate the soul as far as possible from the body” through the avoidance of physical pleasures and pains (Plato 172). According to this definition, the soul can be more or less separated from the body. Since Socrates defines death as the separation of the soul from the body, a soul can be more or less dead (Plato 172). However, when later arguing that the soul is deathless, Socrates says that life is an essential quality of the soul. Just as the number five will not admit the form of the Even, “the soul will never admit the opposite of that which it brings along,” which is death (Plato 195). The notion that a soul can be more or less dead is analogous to the false notion that the number five can be more or less even. Thus, the meaning of “opposite” that Socrates applies to larger and smaller indeed differs from the meaning he applies to being alive and being dead.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In addition, being alive and being dead involve entities: the soul and the body. But larger and smaller involve properties: largeness and smallness. Unlike properties, entities cannot have real opposites. For example, though cats and dogs have distinct differences, they are not opposites. The opposite of a cat would be a non-cat, which is not equivalent to a dog. The opposite of a dog would be a non-dog, which is not equivalent to a cat. Similarly, the opposite of a soul would be a non-soul, which is not equivalent to a body. The opposite of a body would be a non-body, which is not equivalent to a soul.</p>
    <br>
    <p>A potential objection to my argument comes when Socrates describes the differences between the soul and the body. While the soul is composite and resembles the divine, the body is incomposite and resembles the mortal (Plato 180). In this sense, entities can be characterized by their properties. Since the properties of an entity can contrast with the properties of another entity, entities can have real opposites. However, the properties that initially make entities distinct might come to exist in both entities. For example, physical pleasures and pains of the body might shape the soul and make the soul resemble the mortal, like the body. The soul then cannot be the opposite of the body.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Even if Socrates were not to equivocate on the word “opposite,” his argument would nevertheless be unsound. For the rest of my paper, I will treat being alive and being dead as opposites in the same sense as larger and smaller. I will show that Socrates’s Argument from Opposites has two premises that are not true.</p>
    <br>
    <p>First, the premise that there are two processes of generation between opposites is not true. Consider the opposites young and old. Someone who is young becomes older through the process of aging. However, there is no reverse process that can make someone who is old become younger. Although anti-aging processes like cosmetic surgery might give the old the appearance of being young, they do not reverse the process of aging to make the old actually become young. Dying is similarly a unidirectional process between being alive and being dead. There might not be a reverse process to make being dead into being alive again.</p>
    <br>
    <p>A potential objection to my argument is that opposites which initially lack two processes of generation between them can develop such processes through technology. For example, males and females previously lacked two processes of generation. A male could not become a female, and a female could not become a male. But the inventions of male-to-female and female-to-male transgender surgeries created two processes of generation between them. In the future, a reverse aging device could make the old younger again. However, it is not guaranteed that such technologies will exist. For example, limits to technological advancement might prevent the invention of a reverse aging device. Therefore, some opposites might not develop two processes of generation between them. Regardless, according to Socrates, the true definition of a thing must describe the essence of said thing. Since young and old presently lack two processes of generation, a definition of opposites that requires two processes of generation does not describe their essence. It is thus a false definition.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Second, the premise that opposites come to be from opposites is not true. It might be true that life follows death just as death follows life, but this does not mean that life must come from death. For example, peace follows war and war follows peace, but this does not mean that peace must come from war. Another cause besides war could bring about peace, such as conversations that create harmony between newly introduced parties. Similarly, another cause besides death could bring about life.</p>
    <br>
    <p>A possible objection to my argument is that opposites must indeed come from one another because they are co-constitutive binaries. For example, there could be no valley without a hill, since a hill is what establishes the meaningful contrast that brings a valley into existence. Likewise, there could be no hill without a valley, since a valley is what establishes the meaningful contrast that brings a hill into existence. However, being alive and being dead do not necessarily operate in a binary relationship. Consider the states of matter. Solids and liquids differ in properties, and the processes of melting and freezing exist between them. But a gas can undergo deposition to become a solid. There is thus a third entity involved in what might appear to be a binary relationship. Similarly, life and death differ in properties, and the processes of dying and coming to life might exist between them. But perhaps there are materials, such as particles in the atmosphere, from which a soul can be made.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I have reconstructed Socrates’s Argument from Opposites. I have considered all objections to my argument and successfully refuted them. Therefore, I can conclude that Socrates’s argument violates both criteria for soundness. His argument is invalid in that it equivocates on the word “opposite,” because he applies the same definition of “opposite” to gradable properties and ungradable entities. His argument also includes two false premises. First, he does not prove that there are two processes of generation between opposites, since he fails to consider opposites that have only one process of generation between them. Second, he does not successfully establish that opposites come from their opposites, because he neglects the possibility of a third entity that might bring an opposite into existence. My argument did not prove that it is impossible for a soul to be reborn. Socrates may be right that the soul is immortal. But his Argument from Opposites cannot successfully prove this notion.</p>
