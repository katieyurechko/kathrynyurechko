    <h3>Heracles</h3>
    <h5>December 3rd, 2018</h5>
  </div>
  <div class="main">
    <p>“What kind of dog do you own?” asked a potential new friend of mine, sitting to my right in the school cafeteria.</p>
    <br>
    <p><em>Here we go again</em>, I thought to myself. After plenty of practice answering this same question time and time again, I automatically responded, “Actually, I don’t have a dog.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>“You don’t have a <em>dog</em>?” she exclaimed. To her, along with the numerous other near-strangers with whom I’d had practically the same conversation, living without a dog was like breathing without lungs; it was not only impossible, but unimaginable.</p>
    <br>
    <p>“No, I don’t have a dog,” I heard myself reply. “I never did.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>“<em>Why</em>?”</p>
    <br>
    <p>I paused a moment before replying. <em>Should I just tell her the truth?</em> No, I couldn’t. In addition to embarrassing me, a freshman in high school at the time, telling the truth would call for a rather long-winded explanation, one that would surely require more than a lunch period. So with a short, blunt statement that would surely bewilder the poor girl beyond belief, I simply stated, “I don’t like dogs.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>Obviously offended, the girl quickly stood up from the lunch table and walked away, as if, through a mere four words, I had wronged not only her but the entire human race by expressing my disdain for what she would likely describe as the most loveable and caring part of God’s creation. She would never know or understand, though, the true answer to her question. The real reason I never had a dog was not because I didn’t like them. I’d like to believe I wouldn’t have minded dogs if I’d known a nice one at the time. The real reason I didn’t own a dog was because I was afraid.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The only dogs I’d ever met at that point in my life were rather evil and malicious creatures. Their dark, searing eyes pierced me like bullets; their sharp, pointed teeth reminded me of the tip of a sleek, steel knife. Blood disguised as drool would glide down their rigid jaws and drip past their sickly smiles, as if they had just savored the last bit of their delicious prey. Just one glance at one of these lupine creatures was enough to make my hands tremble, my legs shake, and my whole body wreak of sweaty, rotten fear.  How someone could take in one of these dreadful animals as a loving household pet I simply could not understand, at least, not until I vacationed in Greece last April.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Upon arriving in Greece, my parents and I immediately lathered on some sunscreen, slipped on our swimsuits, and made our way down to the beach. We needed some peace and quiet away from our busy lives at home, and I was enthusiastically awaiting such blissful serenity. But just as I looked out at the ocean’s soothing blue waves and finally started to believe I could leave my stresses from home behind, a monstrous figure of black and tan coloration stole my attention as I spotted it lurking threateningly by the ocean shore. I know that some would call this hideous creature a fun-loving and warmhearted household pet; I, on the other hand, deemed it a blood-curdling, spine-chilling beast.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Completely and terribly petrified, I stood frozen while my feet trembled upon the suddenly burning sand. Waves began to pummel the shore as my eyes cautiously scanned from the animal’s head to its tail, evaluating the threat such a terrifying creature could pose not only to my relaxing vacation but to my life in general. I imagined it standing on its hind legs, towering far above my five-foot-one stature. Its grim shadow would surely engulf all of mine within its vast darkness. As the creature stood by the pounding, thrashing ocean waves that churned at about the rate of my stomach inside my chest, I noticed the coarse, dark fur that outlined its exterior, transforming its being into that of a black bear, well-fed but overpowered by a dangerously compelling appetite. </p>
    <br>
    <p>As I continued evaluating this animal, I noticed its enormous, sharp figure grow exponentially larger and sharper. Its features became jarringly real, like I was sitting in a movie theater and just now remembered to put on my three-dimensional glasses, except this time, I didn’t want to see what was before my eyes with any more detail. I wanted to run away.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I tried to lift my feet from the hot, simmering sand, to run as far away from the beach as I possibly could, but the terror that consumed my mind rendered me as immovable as a million bricks. I stood, trapped under the weight of my own fear, as I watched paws of premonition pound their way through blazing specks of gravel that parted in their path. My skin compressed tightly against my bones, allowing room for not even a single breath, like a boa constrictor to its prey. My heart started to pound loudly within my chest, the vibrations it sent like shock waves jolting from my head to my toes. My stomach became an entity unto itself, tossing and turning so ferociously that the waves of the sea could not even compare. Before I could summon the power to move, I was face to face with what I had thought to be my greatest fear.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Something was different, though, about this personification of my anxiety. As it stood silently in the sand and the waves began to settle into a calm and tranquil slumber, I noticed that its eyes were unlike any I’d ever seen. A crystal cave of ice, its left eye glistened with secrecy. Though I gazed into its icy exterior, a glassy coating enclosing a mysterious and possibly troubled past, I could not seem to see beyond its secretive and spotless façade. Its right eye, though, was a deep brown pool of warmth and security. It emitted a vulnerability, a compassion, I had not known such a creature could possess. Suddenly, fueled by some inner power I didn’t even attempt to hinder or defeat, my right hand outstretched itself and gently stroked the fur encircling the canine’s distinct eyes.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I felt the dog’s luscious coat of chocolate softness part with my finger’s gentle touch, and I watched its cheeks softly rise as its formerly rigid jaw molded into a loving smile. As I lifted my hand and pet lightly behind its previously pointed and astute ear, the tip of its ear folded unto itself as its quiet eyes shut and its large head rolled back into a peaceful daze of comfort.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Gently I was awoken to my own presence once again. Such mysteriously calming eyes and thick, luscious fur had miraculously transported me to a state of complete peace and serenity. I hadn’t noticed it at the time, but my hands had stopped trembling. My muscles had relaxed as air flowed evenly into my lungs and throughout my entire body, filling me up with a new sense of life and love. My heart had ceased its pounding and instead began to pitter-patter within my chest like a slow, summer rain. As I noticed this, a cool breeze wrapped itself smoothly around me and swirled lovingly from my toes to my ear, where at once, it whispered the words, “Be at peace.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>Throughout the rest of my time in Greece, I kept finding myself going back to the beach, not to swim in the ocean or tan in the sand, but to spend time with my four-footed friend, my fear-become-companion. One night, as I strolled onto the beach underneath the unending expanse of beautifully illuminated night sky, I discovered my pal asleep by the sea, little golden specks of sand outlining his closed, fuzzy eyelids. My foot gradually melted into the soft sand as I began to make my way toward my new friend. Suddenly, when I took a step closer, he awakened from his blissful slumber and made his way quickly through the soft, cool sand to stand at my side. When an unknown figure appeared spontaneously on the opposite end of the beach, the so-far silent dog let out a thunderous and unexpected howl that echoed throughout the distance. “What was that for?” I implored, staring into his deep brown and crystal eyes. But he did not answer. His eyes, unmoving, remained glued on the figure in the distance. It was then that I realized what he was doing. He was protecting me.</p>
    <br>
    <p>From that night on, my dog friend quickly took it upon himself to become my loving protector, my mighty guard against any danger that could possibly befall me. Upon every trip to the beach, he’d greet me with a joyous smile etched across his affectionate face. I’d reach out my hand and slowly run it up and down his soft, furry coat, and he would refuse to leave my side. I couldn’t believe I was ever afraid of my loyal bastion of safety.</p>
    <br>
    <p>On our last day in Greece, my parents and I decided to make one final trip to the beach. I needed to say thank you to my furry friend for protecting me so ardently. No matter how hard it would be, I needed to say goodbye. The waves of the sea were so somber and still; the sky turned a foreboding gray. As I sunk my foot into the sand, my eyes wandered up and down the shore, searching earnestly for my dog, but he was nowhere to be found. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Thoughts of worry and sadness darkened my mind like the clouds did the sky. <em>What if I never get to say goodbye? Will I ever see him again?</em> But all of a sudden, out from underneath a beach chair, rose a heroic gentleman dressed in black and tan fur. I felt a tremendous smile stretch out across my face as my cheeks parted to make room for the extreme joy and serenity I felt knowing I had a chance to say goodbye to my favorite canine. I got down on my knees and wrapped my arms around him, resting my head up against his fur as a way of thanking him for all he had done. I slowly stood up from the sand, which now coated my knees and shins just as it had covered my furry friend’s eyelids the night I visited him on the beach, when he revealed himself to be my loyal and trusty guardian. I turned to walk away and glanced back to take one final look into his brown and crystal eyes, then I slowly glided my hand side-to-side through the crisp, clear air and said, “Goodbye.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>A moment later, a young man dressed in a server’s uniform approached me.</p>
    <br>
    <p>“So I see you’ve taken a liking to our dog over there,” he said, pointing at my pal.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I smiled. “Yes, I really have. He’s the kindest, most caring dog I’ve ever met.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>“He’s a stray, you know. We found him a few years ago. He was so small and frail that we just had to take him in. He stays up at that house, over there.” He pointed to a small, quaint house at the top of a hill that rose up from the shore. “He’s a real warrior. I’ve never known a stronger, more selfless dog than him in my life.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>It was then that I realized, despite how well I’d gotten to know my fuzzy companion, I’d never even learned his name, so I asked what it was.</p>
    <br>
    <p>“His name is Heracles,” the young man replied. “That’s Greek for Hercules.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>Upon refreshing my memory of this mythological god, I found that he is known for being the divine protector of mankind. I can think of no better name to give my miraculous guardian, the first dog who ever made me feel safe.</p>
