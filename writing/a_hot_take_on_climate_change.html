    <h3>A Hot Take on Climate Change</h3>
    <h5>November 20th, 2020</h5>
  </div>
  <div class="main">
    <p>Renowned philosopher and ecologist Garrett Hardin states that combatting environmental degradation “requires a fundamental extension in morality” (Hardin 1243). To highlight his view of human beings as inherently self-interested and economically rational creatures, he refers to a “tragedy of the commons,” which occurs when people use a shared resource without a coordinated plan and thus cause its depletion (Hardin 1244). This perspective brings Hardin to promote mutually-agreed-upon coercive arrangements like sanctions as the best means to alleviate such deterioration; other philosophers including Walter Sinnott-Armstrong and Baylor Johnson have further championed collective moral obligations like campaigning for regulatory policies in addressing a paramount contributor to this destruction: the climate emergency. In light of these views, many contemplate whether they can effectually promote communal change in the absence of individual efforts. They consider what they as human beings morally ought to do to address what is arguably the most challenging and far-reaching global ethical issue today. I argue that a moral obligation to reduce personal contributions to climate change must underly any collective responsibility, as individual choices must align with and fuel sustained political engagement to stimulate effective widespread action.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The need for integrity in spurring productive political change calls for an individual obligation to reduce emissions when a collective obligation exists. Environmental ethicist Marion Hourdequin deems this integrity not merely as an avoidance of hypocrisy but as a “moral integrity,” one which helps individuals develop ethically while also supporting social institutions that foster large-scale moral transformations (Hourdequin 772). Two critical terms comprise moral integrity, the first of which is integrality: “the internalization of certain commitments, such that these commitments are central to an individual’s identity.” Integrality thus requires that one’s dedications be consistently expressed not only at the political but at the personal level, for such stability promotes one’s status as an honest and upright being. In turn, when adherence to a cause is truly integral, it further encourages both personal and communal action as part of this cycle, for an individual honors his or her devotion instinctively and without deliberation in both realms (Hourdequin 772). The second aspect of moral integrity corresponds directly with integrality. It is termed integration: “a kind of unity among the elements in which they form a coherent, ideally a harmonious, structure.” With respect to the climate crisis, one can envision these elements as individual and collective responses that act as pieces of a puzzle. If a communal obligation is necessary, any personal efforts or pieces must align with those communal efforts; otherwise, the puzzle will remain incomplete and its bigger picture unseen, for the collective pieces alone cannot form a solidified whole. This exemplifies the need for unilateral endeavors to correspond with political aims. For instance, consider an individual who promotes emissions-limiting policies while thoughtlessly increasing his or her own emissions. Firstly, it is morally-problematic for a climate change activist to be wasteful and inconsiderate in this sense, as it is worrisome to consider somebody campaigning for initiatives that he or she presently acts against. Furthermore, it is unlikely that such an individual would lobby for climate-protecting policies as ardently and effectively as someone whose commitments are integrated across the personal and social spheres. Together with integrality, integration thus works to establish a form of equilibrium between these domains, as any personal efforts guide collective reform and vice versa. Dedication at the personal level is therefore likely to bring about a more informed understanding of the efficacy of potential political changes. For example, having solar panels installed on one’s home would likely lead one to better comprehend the importance of climate-related legislation, like that regarding net metering. It would also likely prompt one to campaign more devotedly for reform than if he or she were only to hold an abstract perception of laws concerning net metering as beneficial (Hourdequin 776). Lastly, those who have experimented with solar-design homes can better inform others about their practicality as well as any potentially necessary considerations or modifications, which is liable to bring individuals to consider sustainable energy sources more seriously themselves (Johnson 285). These critical components of integrity thus deem an individual obligation to work against climate change as necessary in promoting both honest and effective political action.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The conception of individuals as social beings lies at the core of collective change, which necessitates an individual obligation to combat the climate crisis as the basis of any larger responsibility. In viewing humankind as a relational structure, it is evident that one’s personal actions are inherently tied to his or her social meaning. For instance, the moral integrity that I described above promotes a firm sense of identity, or a means of “defining, describing, and locating oneself” (Armstrong et. al 44). However, because all human beings are social animals, this identity is not purely individual; rather, it is at least partially derived from the groups to which individuals belong. The expectations of these groups influence the attitudes and actions of its members, and research even suggests that identity itself is dynamic, meaning that facets of it can become more salient and thus guide corresponding behaviors in response to social cues (Armstrong et. al 44). Esteemed philosopher Confucius viewed all individuals as social beings who consistently interact with others. On the Confucian view, through which each person is defined relationally, personal actions are efficacious and morally significant largely because of their ability to inspire change in this social regard (Hourdequin 774). Individuals who engage in personal initiatives to ride their bicycle rather than car to work, for example, serve as “moral models” with a certain compelling power. As honorable actors, their decision to conserve fuel emits a message of concern for the commons, and such a choice promotes large-scale reform by inspiring others to change as well. This reality manifests itself in two ways. Firstly, individuals tend to view the restraint of others as a template for their own restraint. When one drives by the cyclist on his or her way to work, one is more likely to consider climate-friendly alternatives to or means of driving than if he or she had not observed the cyclist. A decision to pursue those considerations can similarly inspire even more positive change. In addition to leading others to evaluate their driving habits in the present, the cyclist’s means of commuting to work might even cause others to contemplate their emissions as they purchase their next vehicle (Hourdequin 773). Secondly, as individuals engage as connected members of a community, like that which acts in opposition to climate change, they react to individuals’ care or lack thereof for the commons with moral responses. They are likely to applaud and thus encourage ecofriendly actions, sometimes even deciding to engage in similar actions themselves, and criticize and thus discourage environmentally-harmful practices, sometimes offering suggestions to those taking part in such endeavors about feasible ways to change (Hourdequin 775). Those like Hardin argue that individuals are rational economic actors and that the measures I described above are therefore ineffective. However, I hold that individuals do not view themselves as such beings. For example, research has shown that people seldom purchase hybrid cars with rational economic considerations in mind; in reality, they buy such vehicles “to make a statement, to express their commitment to the environment, and to discuss with others their choice.” This data demonstrates that human beings are indeed relational. They are not socially-disconnected, meticulously self-interested actors, and their decisions to engage carefully with the environment do in fact encourage others to do the same (Hourdequin 776). The influence that social media posts from peers and individuals like Greta Thunberg hold on one’s thoughts and actions furthers this point cross-culturally, as it demonstrates the extensive social connections that human beings from across the global community share in an increasingly globalized world. Because unilateral actions do fuel multilateral involvement in opposition to the climate crisis, they must form the foundation of any communal obligation to combat climate change.</p>
    <br>
    <p>One objection to my argument is that individual actions like reducing one’s own emissions will not be mirrored by enough people to make a worthwhile impact; because of this, proponents claim that no personal obligation exists in regards to the climate emergency. Walter Sinnott-Armstrong uses a leisurely Sunday drive as an example in furthering his premise, that “it is better to enjoy your Sunday drive while working to change the law so as to make it illegal for you to enjoy your Sunday driving,” for the aforementioned reason (Sinnott-Armstrong 766). Likewise, Baylor Johnson directly states that reducing one’s own personal use is “a fruitless sacrifice” (Johnson 283). However, I argue that more important factors are involved in promoting widescale change than solely the number of individuals engaged in personal efforts. For instance, a person of great political influence may be one of the drivers who contemplatively passes the cyclist each day on the way to work. Even though the influential individual is just one person, one person of such power may spur more governmental action than thousands of possible observers. Additionally, one individual like the cyclist may so strongly impact another through his or her dedication to personal environmental initiatives that such dedication inspires a far-reaching passion in the observer; from just one personally-impactful observance, the witness may develop a fervor for eco-friendly political lobbying that then proceeds to garnish widespread, sustained support. In this sense, individual actions may serve as critical support or reinforcement for large-scale policies or even as catalysts for emerging communal initiatives. Furthermore, apart from considerations of political influence and personal motivation, which are related to the Confucian perspective, individual obligations to counter climate change must exist alongside any collective duties purely from an integrity-based standpoint. The integrality and integration that I discussed above require a sort of synchrony between personal and collective actions that both Sinnott-Armstrong and Johnson fail to acknowledge. This is the case because one must consistently express his or her commitments both individually and politically to avoid working at cross purposes and promote truly effective change (Hourdequin 772).</p>
    <br>
    <p>A related objection to my argument is that the “mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon by the majority of the people affected” that Hardin proposes is sufficient to combat climate change, thus deeming any individual obligation unnecessary (Hardin 1247). However, I hold that coercion lacking in personal moral commitment, as Hardin’s form is, cannot bring forth stable social change, as it necessitates not only a change in action but a change in thought. If individuals do not affirm the need to regulate their emissions, policy itself can at best achieve a severely limited level of effectivity. For this reason, altering political structures and not people only allows tensions between individual and collective conceptions of the good to persist (Hourdequin 775). Thus, the “real moral obligations” regarding the climate crisis are not only “to get governments to do their job to prevent the disaster of excessive global warming” through top-down measures, as Sinnott-Armstrong states, but to engage in bottom-up personal initiatives to reduce emissions (Sinnott-Armstrong 766). Some like Johnson further argue that such instances of individual restraint are “self-eliminating,” as the honorable lose aspects of their livelihood to “the ignorant, the unscrupulous, or those who reasonably doubt that all will voluntarily reduce their use” (Johnson 274). Because one cannot rationally expect his or her unilateral action to prevent harm, they posit, one has no individual moral obligation to combat the climate crisis. However, eradicating any sense of personal responsibility on this basis is unsound. It is difficult to remain ignorant about which actions harm the environment as climate change grows increasingly more publicized and pressing, and, as I explored through evidence against Hardin’s conception of persons, it is uncommon for human beings to act as predominantly self-interested creatures, detached from a concern for others. By reducing personal emissions, individuals can work to inspire those outside of these two limited groups to decrease their emissions, thus generating a sufficient mass of people who can exercise their moral persuasion over those who hesitate to engage personally in combatting the climate emergency. These individuals can then go on to voice their commitment to protecting the environment more passionately and effectively into the political realm. They demonstrate the necessity of moral change over mutual coercion in promoting beneficial collective action as well as the inaccuracy of a self-eliminating perspective on individual reduction; thus, in the existence of any communal responsibility, these realities make clear the need for an individual obligation to confront climate change.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Hardin’s call for a “fundamental extension in morality” expresses his belief in a collective obligation to alleviate environmental crises, like the climate emergency. Throughout this discussion, I argue that a personal moral obligation must serve as the foundation of such a communal responsibility to promote large-scale efficacious change. I begin by explaining that integrity is essential in bringing about effective political initiatives and thus necessitates a personal obligation to reduce emissions when a collective obligation exists. I then describe how individual actions cannot be isolated from one’s relational being and therefore promote productive social change, which further deems personal responsibilities as necessary in light of larger duties. I conclude my argument by refuting the objections that no individual obligation exists because personal actions will not make a significant impact, coercion is sufficient in alleviating the climate crisis, and individual efforts are self-eliminating; rather, I respectively maintain that individual environmental decisions inspire critical change and uphold integrity regardless, that coercion is insufficient in promoting stable moral engagement, and lastly, that a perspective of self-elimination is unreasoned. These steps together promote my argument that a personal obligation to reduce emissions is necessary in the presence of a communal responsibility to act against climate change, as it coincides with and promotes political action that is both honest and effective. Individual initiatives thus serve as a foundational “extension in morality” alongside any collective efforts.</p>
