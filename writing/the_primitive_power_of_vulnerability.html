    <h3>The Primitive Power of Vulnerability</h3>
    <h5>December 10th, 2021</h5>
  </div>
  <div class="main">
    <p>I remember the day my friend and I went tubing and missed the last exit. The current forced us forward; a fatal drop-off loomed ahead. When I realized this, my left hand immediately grasped onto a large rock. And to my surprise, my right grabbed hold of my friend’s arm, unwilling to let her go. I had always thought that survival was exclusively self-seeking. But at that very moment, I realized there was more to the story.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Human nature, to me, is inherently caring and community-centered. It took a near-death experience to help me learn this lesson, that when survival is at the forefront of the human mind, extending a helping hand naturally overpowers “survival of the fittest.” From an evolutionary standpoint, this makes perfect sense: the first humans realized that foraging collectively rather than alone was the best way to survive. Foragers who cared for one another in groups outpaced and outproduced those who worked in solitude, and their communities thrived as a result.</p>
    <br>
    <p>However, today I see humanity as largely egocentric. My experience with the college admissions process highlights this modern state; numerous high school peers scowled at my successes, deeming admissions a zero-sum game in which my wins meant their losses. Puett and Gross-Loh suggest that our contemporary, self-interested ambition is in fact rooted in the human survival instinct: if we do not compete with one another, they claim, we fear getting left behind (<em>The Path</em>, 101). Historically, getting left behind meant dying of starvation, and the key to evading it was collective foraging. Perhaps the key to getting what we desire out of life, even in our competitive meritocratic age, has always been connecting with others.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Personally, I view the good life as the life one leads as their fullest self. The more I delve into my talents, the more I perceive my life as good. In high school, I learned that I am gifted at public speaking; as I grew in my passion for it, I felt more complete, like a more sincere form of myself. In this sense, the good life is unique to each person, and each person’s version of it requires that they pursue their gifts.</p>
    <br>
    <p>To act in accordance with one’s gifts, however, requires that one realize one’s gifts in the first place. I do not believe that this can be a purely individual task. I might never have understood my aptitude for public speaking had my English teacher not seen that potential in me and pointed it out. Puett and Gross-Loh might suggest that what sparked this was my utilization of weakness: perhaps I played weakness over strength in class discussions by inconspicuously guiding my peers to acknowledge their shared beliefs (<em>The Path</em>, 116-117). However, I trust that my vulnerability was the key. Only when I am openly empathetic, not covertly skillful, can I allow others to bring out what is truly the best in me, for being vulnerable is what allows them to discern my greatest qualities most clearly. Vulnerability is therefore necessary to ignite and consistently fuel the process of poiesis (<em>All Things Shining</em>, 211). My decision to engage courageously and genuinely with others’ perspectives in class, even if that meant my views being misunderstood or opposed, enabled my teacher to bring out the best in me. Her decision to reach out to me about my gift, even if that meant my rejection of her stance, ultimately allowed us to embark on a journey of reciprocally beneficial becoming.</p>
    <br>
    <p>But vulnerability was not an inherent trait of mine. It was a skill cultivated through a particular kind of practice. Confucius would likely suggest that this practice involved as-if rituals, or pockets of ordered interactions in which I pretended as-if I were my classmates to understand them more fully (<em>The Path</em> 33). Although doing this during class discussions undoubtedly helped me grow in vulnerability, initially cultivating this skill and wholeheartedly developing it required a nuanced form of the Confucian ritual.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The historic emergence of rituals was grounded in an acknowledgement of survival as other-oriented. Early humans noted which of their interactions resulted in a sense of peace and repeated those interactions to structure their existence. They constructed order not alone but through their engagements with others (<em>The Path</em> 50). Human patterns today, however, tend to divert our attention away from our reciprocal dependence upon one another. I spent numerous years of my life scrolling through social media feeds, suspended in patterns of self-obsession with the goal of making my personal reality more controlled. In regularly hiding behind a screen of pseudo-interactions, I felt invulnerable, as-if no word or deed could hurt me. But the moment I found myself thrown into the grips of nature, I knew that no semblance of virtual order could save me.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Existing just temporarily under the control of the rapids made me come to see human beings as “finite, vulnerable, [and] mutually dependable” creatures (<em>Philosophy and Real Politics</em> 37). I could no longer live as-if I was indestructible because I realized that life’s waters could overpower me at any given moment. Rather than fear this, I decided to embrace it. I began living my life as-if it were in constant jeopardy by taking preliminary risks, like lessening my use of social media and speaking up for the first time in class. Through delving into reality to create and embrace these new pockets of disorder, I grew to operate within the messiness of life rather than strive to place myself outside of it. My English teacher and I both put this into practice by refusing to pretend that we “had it all together.” We chose to put our emotions in danger by speaking up in class about moments when we felt just as lost or disheartened as the literary characters we studied. Acknowledging our finitude enabled us to grasp that there is no guarantee we will partake in certain interactions, like our class discussions, again. Embracing the finitude of every moment ultimately allowed us to live vulnerably and thus engage in the fullest form of poiesis with one another.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Some may suggest that vulnerability is antithetical to power. But I see vulnerability as power, for it allows one to connect with others and, through that connection, better realize one’s fullest self. In this sense, vulnerability is a crucial component of the good life. It paves the way for what I consider an ideal mode of human interaction: a politics of vulnerability. To practice this politics requires recurrent leaps into finitude, since humans must actively acknowledge the temporary nature of human life and the moments within it to live most vulnerably (<em>Philosophy and Real Politics</em> 30). Machiavelli might suggest that instead of living vulnerably, we should aim to create maximum order amidst what he deems a “violent river” of fortune (<em>Prince</em> 98). But if we build metaphorical dikes and dams, we exemplify a fear of fortune that augments its power. Alternatively, if we embrace the flow of disorder in our lives, we tap into the power of vulnerability by introducing moments of potential chaos and making the most of those that we encounter. We mimic fortune itself, producing our own disorder and seizing the unpredictable moments that fortune produces.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Thinking back to the rapids, I cannot help but recall another pivotal piece of the story: the man who appeared across the river from my friend and me. I remember watching him turn away and, in that moment of complete disorder, feeling a spark of vulnerability from deep within myself resound in piercingly emotive sobs. I cried so deeply for help that I had to close my eyes. But when I began to open them again, I saw the man wading sideways across the water, ready to save us. He extended a hand to my friend as I had done, and the collective weight of our bodies carried us through what had seemed an impenetrable current.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I will forever see the man in the rapids as a hero. However, Hobbes would likely emphasize that he committed an absurdity, as he neglected the instrumental rationality meant to direct him toward self-preservation (<em>Leviathan</em> 79). But I see Hobbes’s dichotomy between self- and other-preservation as fundamentally flawed. Rather than disregarding instrumental rationality, the hero most fully exemplifies it. Hobbes himself depicts a ruler as physically composed of his subjects. In this sense, a harm to any of the subjects produces a harm to the ruler himself (<em>Leviathan</em> Frontispiece). I believe that like Hobbes’s sovereign, we are each a composite of numerous others. But these others are not demarcated, self-possessed individuals. Rather, they are connected to and composed of countless human beings. I instinctually acted upon this understanding when I grabbed my friend’s hand, and the action of the man in the rapids exemplifies it even more fully. He knew that the loss of two strangers would induce a harm to himself, since every person who has ever connected with another lies within him. Each person he loves undoubtedly cares for someone else, who cares for another in an endless pattern. The man understood that our loss would have affected his ability to survive, for it would have cut a hole in his own finite personhood. He acted with utter vulnerability, entering our pocket of disorder in an acknowledgement of our shared finitude. Thus, in addition to viewing heroism as Dreyfus and Kelly’s situational responsiveness, I see it as being vulnerable: returning to our true nature by bravely and compassionately extending a hand to others, rather than succumbing to the moral calculus of self-seeking desires (<em>All Things Shining</em>, 8).</p>
