    <h3>Big Data, Even Bigger Danger</h3>
    <h5>May 22nd, 2021</h5>
  </div>
  <div class="main">
    <p>In 2018, the Cambridge Analytica scandal brutally awakened millions across the globe to a harsh truth: what they believed was their own private data could be exploited in the blink of an eye. The likes, dislikes, and online patterns of millions of Facebook users were utilized without their knowledge to aid political campaigns, like that of Donald Trump in 2016 (Kozlowska). The ability of these massive sets of data to shatter pivotal notions of American democracy and individual privacy appalled many. But the shards themselves may not be our deepest concern. While widespread data aggregation jeopardizes critical democratic values, the paramount issue involved in big data is the danger that it poses to fundamental conceptions of human dignity. Throughout my paper, I focus on social media platforms and argue that to safeguard our human worth, the United States government must enact a ban on commercial data harvesting.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The exponential expansion of data aggregation capacities has led many to consider how such collections affect democracy. Ethicist L. M. Sacasas coined the term “magnificent bribe” to describe what he sees as a central facet of this debate: each person who uses technology may reap the rewards it offers but must “likewise agree to take everything offered…in the precise quantities that the system, rather than the person, requires” (Sacasas 38). This is disconcertingly similar to how women exist in comparison to men when husbands have legal power over their wives (Pettit). Some may respond that this analogy is imperfect; unlike women in an oppressive society, tech users can freely choose whether to engage with the products that enter them into the arrangement. However, it is critical to note that it is nearly impossible to live in modern society without utilizing technological systems and services. For example, those without smartphones are essentially ostracized from meeting contemporary demands like sending important emails and communicating quickly at any point throughout the day. Those without social media may be viewed suspiciously as people who are hiding something about their lives and thus be denied important social or occupational opportunities. This makes clear that the “magnificent bribe” is not merely bad but authoritarian in nature, for a free choice to enter into it does not presently exist. Others have depicted data itself as a sort of property that humans own; in other words, when I post something online, it is a product of my efforts and is not to be stored or sorted. But the existence of data aggregation techniques brings some like scholar Shoshana Zuboff to declare, “We never said [the tech companies] could take these things from us. They simply declared them to be theirs for the taking—by taking them.” Corporations like Facebook reply that their users did say that they could take these things, for all users consent to data collection by agreeing to Terms of Service. However, the consent that users give is neither meaningful nor informed. Many agree to conditions without ever reading them, and a close look at the Terms of Service employed by various platforms reveals the cause of this apparent negligence: the word count and complexity of agreements typically surpass those of the United States Constitution, which students and scholars across the nation regularly struggle to understand (Malik). Additionally, the business models of social networking services rely on extensive advertising, targeted at specific users to bring in the greatest possible profit. Algorithms not only access personal data but analyze it, as this is what allows developers to determine which ads directed at which individuals will generate the largest sum of money. The flourishing of social media corporations thus rests on violating privacy because the consent that users give is largely devoid of meaning (Kozlowska). What becomes of American democracy when corporate actors construct their own totalitarian regime remains an open question, but it is clear that the amassing of big data conflicts with ideals of personal freedom, property, and privacy. These foreboding truths suggest that the United States must at least regulate social networking services to safeguard fundamental democratic values.</p>
    <br>
    <p>One objection to the idea that the United States must restrict the data-gathering capacities of social media platforms is that such restrictions could curtail the enhancement of democratic ideals. Proponents argue that placing restrictions on tech companies is illogical if done to promote democracy. However, I maintain that this objection misinterprets the issue at hand. Restrictions on data harvesting would not detract from democratic ideals; rather, as I suggest above, they would work to enhance those values. Still, many like Stephen Tully laud social media for its “inherently democratic” nature (155). Tully himself describes how promoting freedom of expression directly correlates with an increase in a central component of any democratic country: political participation (160). For this reason, proponents sometimes hold that regulating any component of social media threatens to undermine all that it does to enhance democracy. In response, I argue that social media is <em>not</em> inherently democratic, even once duplicitous data manipulation practices are removed from consideration. Though it could be argued that, at their genesis, social media platforms served as a means of enabling open communication and the sharing of personal thoughts, it cannot be ignored that they presently stand in opposition to key democratic principles. A prime example is the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which explicitly revealed how personal thoughts and emotions can be exploited to elect the president of a democracy (Kozlowska). In describing how big data is altering democratic governance, professor Venkat Motupalli states that “[social media] can be a great thing, connecting creators, thinkers, and doers all over the world,” but the key word in this quote is “can” (76). If political discussions are to be enriched, they must display honesty and accountability, both of which are cloaked when deliberators are concealed behind a screen (Tully 170). It thus appears that the aforementioned objection to legal restrictions is unsound.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The outrage that followed the Cambridge Analytica scandal suggests that more lies beneath such hostile emotions than pure political dealings. For centuries, philosophers such as John Locke have promoted rights as “natural,” meaning that they were in existence prior to the creation of the political institutions aimed at protecting them. Structures of governance, therefore, do not precede rights; notions of the importance of honoring human dignity do. It is not the rights themselves that lie at the heart of human aspirations but, instead, what they represent. This might help to explain why nearly eighty-seven million individuals felt that Cambridge Analytica’s use of their information constituted a data breach, even though no data was stolen and no systems were hacked (Kozlowska). In daily life, human beings buy things that others sell: groceries at the grocery store, clothes at the mall, and food at restaurants. What is strange about tech companies as money-making enterprises is that the products they sell are, essentially, human beings. Some of the most intimate details of our lives are marketed to advertising companies, even though we intend for them to be seen only by our “friends” or “followers” online (Brey 106). Even people with public social media accounts appear deeply hurt upon realizing that platforms sell their personal information. In this sense, advocate Frank Schirrmacher’s claim that technology determines masters and slaves is not an exaggeration: tech companies control, dominate, and manipulate human beings for particular economic ends. They obtain user data without truly informed consent and dehumanize their “products” as slavedrivers did their “property” (Zuboff). Though data aggregation is typically hidden from view, the felt effects of this power imbalance are made evident through instances like the Cambridge Analytica scandal and the upset that ensued. Nonetheless, data collection practices undermine human worth irrespective of humans noticing them. Manipulation is another critical factor to note. Online platforms like Facebook were specifically designed to make individuals addicted so that they would generate more data; much like drug addicts, social media “users” become mere objects, in this case directed by algorithms. Facebook’s first president Sean Parker explicitly revealed this incentive: “How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?” (Sacasas 37). If this sounds like a research question, it is because it effectively is one. Social media is a massive, underregulated experiment in which human beings are the lab rats to be prodded and programmed at the will of tech giants. By promising to manage some of the most innately human components of our lives and stockpiling them in unreachable data warehouses, social media begins to separate our memories, thoughts, and experiences from ourselves (Sacasas 39). It threatens to redefine what it means to live as a human being.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Some respond to these criticisms by stating that virtual content in aggregate can be a useful tool to discover patterns and trace probabilities of human behavior. For example, if online talk of insurrections is on the rise, it may serve as a warning sign to the police. However, even if this was the original intent of big data, “function creep” has allowed the focus to shift from investigation for the sake of the people to analysis for the good of corporations (Zuboff). A prime example is the fact that government agents did not respond to copious posts of the impending attack on the United States Capitol in January of 2021; though some may assert that this negligence was purposeful, it at least appears to show that safeguarding national security is not a prominent goal of data harvesting. Since human dignity is under attack as long as tech companies amass personal data, it is evident that the government must intercede. Some may counter that intervention in corporations is not a proper role of government, but I respond that when human dignity is in danger, governmental action is the most secure response. The complaints of many following the Cambridge Analytica scandal suggest that “reader-friendly and prominent privacy notices” might be a beneficial tool (Kozlowska). When individuals attempt to post something online, they could be notified succinctly of the potential consequences that might ensue. However, this response seems to restrain individual freedoms to share content while allowing social media companies to continue harvesting the information they obtain. A more ethical approach may be to promote “participatory transparency,” or to present users with clear Terms of Service that they themselves help to decide (Dreyer and Zaibarth 534). Establishing a group of users alongside experts may be the most just means of responding to ethical neglect on the part of tech companies, as doing so works to combat privacy concerns and truly embodies ideals of a deliberative democracy. But this approach too suffers from a major flaw: it assumes that something inherent in corporate data aggregation is morally worth maintaining, at least to some degree. However, the minimal national security benefits that may arise from big data agglomeration do not outweigh the dignity-neglecting realities of such practices. For this reason, I propose a national ban on the commercial compilation of big data. Though the tight affiliation between tech companies and political groups may make it difficult to enact, citizens must push for this response to recognize and respect the inherent value of a human life.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The amassing of big data threatens human beings in various ways. Throughout my paper, I argue for a ban on corporate big data collection by discussing numerous significant considerations. I begin by explaining the ways in which data harvesting threatens to undermine pivotal democratic values and why this calls for governmental interference. I then refute the notion that legal restrictions would act in opposition to democratic enhancement, which provokes a discussion of the dignity-based understandings that underly every governmentally protected right. I lastly evaluate claims of the benefits of big data to arrive at my proposition, that the importance of upholding human dignity necessitates a national ban on commercial data aggregation. However, my argument does not address the fact that “we have convinced ourselves that prosperity and happiness lie in the direction of limitlessness” (Sacasas 39). Perhaps pursuing infinite technological advancement is not the solution that will best uphold the values most critical to human flourishing. The response that most respects human dignity may involve a reconsideration of how we use the technologies that, presently, use us.</p>
