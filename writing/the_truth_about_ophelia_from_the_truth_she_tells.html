    <h3>The Truth About Ophelia from the Truth She Tells</h3>
    <h5>March 19th, 2019</h5>
  </div>
  <div class="main">
    <p>The translation of Ophelia into Greek is the word “help,” and it is more than a mere coincidence that Shakespeare would choose to grant one of his own characters that very name. In Shakespeare’s play <em>Hamlet</em>, Ophelia is the daughter of Polonius, a father with strict expectations, who lives under the domineering rule of King Claudius of Denmark during the late middle ages. One of only two female characters in the play, Ophelia finds herself torn between her own desires expressed through her relationship with Prince Hamlet and the rules placed upon her by her father and the rest of male society, and this discord ultimately leads her to her own demise. Shakespeare uses Ophelia’s descent into madness and her ultimate death in <em>Hamlet</em> to comment on female oppression of the time, thus painting Ophelia as a truthful heroine rather than a sacrificial victim through her escape from a hypocritical and contradictory male world.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The conflict Ophelia endures regarding her identity, who she is and who she is supposed to be, is ultimately what drives her into madness. While some critics argue that Ophelia is an innocent girl “too good for the corrupt world in which she finds herself” (Mellor), Ophelia is not the virtuous figure they make her out to be. According to Mellor, “There is no more bizarre aspect of the misreading of Hamlet’s character than the assumption that…Ophelia is a correct and timid virgin of exquisite sensibilities.” Ophelia is just as bawdy as Hamlet, as seen through their flirtatious exchange at the Mousetrap play. When Hamlet jokes with Ophelia and asks if she thinks he is talking about sex, she replies, “I think nothing, my lord” (Shakespeare 3.2.124), the word “nothing” being a common sexual reference of the time. Ophelia then continues to flirt with Hamlet as she responds to his inappropriate jokes with such remarks as “you are merry, my lord” (Shakespeare 3.2.129), thus proving that she does not “suffer Hamlet’s vile insults against herself personally and against women in general” (Mellor) but rather enjoys the humor and even returns it back to Hamlet. Even though Ophelia’s conversations with Hamlet allude to her sexual impurity, she does remain pure in her obedience and love of her father, Polonius. According to Fran Richmond, referenced in Mellor’s critique, “A dutiful, obedient, and loving daughter, [Ophelia] acts on Polonius’s wishes not only out of what was for the time conventional obedience, but also from a deeply felt respect for her father’s judgement and wisdom.” For instance, when Polonius tells Ophelia not to see Hamlet anymore, she immediately agrees, saying, “As you did command I did repel his letters and denied his access to me” (Shakespeare 2.2.120-121). She even lies to Hamlet, telling him that Polonius is home when in reality he is eavesdropping on their conversation (Shakespeare 3.1.142), therefore demonstrating that she “[puts] her sense of love and duty for [her father] above her sense of love and duty for [Hamlet]” (Mabillard). However, amidst her obedience, Ophelia is still sexually attracted to Hamlet and his vulgar wit, and her sexual innuendo with him contrasted with her obedience to her father’s wishes represents perfectly how Ophelia is suspended between two different worlds. This internal struggle of Ophelia’s, her inability to balance her own impure wishes along with society’s expectations to be chaste, eventually leads her into insanity.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Through Ophelia’s madness, Shakespeare comments on the absurdity of the times in not condoning the expression of woman’s true sexuality and individual identity. To accomplish this, Shakespeare incorporates songs that Ophelia chants in her insanity and uses them as powerful symbols of her liberation. While critics claim that “the bawdy songs [Ophelia sings] in front of Laertes, Gertrude, and Claudius are somber reminders that the corrupt world has taken its toll on the poor Ophelia” (Mabillard), the songs instead serve to show how Ophelia, in her shocked and distressed state, feels she is finally able to proclaim the truth. For example, Ophelia heavily hints at her possible loss of virginity to Hamlet as she sings, “[He] let in the maid, that out a maid never departed more” (Shakespeare 4.5.59-60), which a “sane” person would most likely not reveal, especially to one’s own brother, Queen, and King. Shakespeare shows the effect Ophelia’s underlying erotic desire holds on her by intertwining Ophelia’s sexual songs with those regarding her deep love for Polonius. When she repeats, “He is dead and gone” (Shakespeare 4.5.34), Ophelia effectively stresses the shattered link between her own lust and her father’s expectations of chastity, proving that the two cannot coexist beautifully but only in broken verses of song and fits of madness. However, the symbol of the flowers, which Ophelia delivers to major characters in the play, displays that she does not “[crumble] into insanity” (Mabillard) but boldly traverses uncharted waters of truth. By giving flowers representing adultery to Claudius and female sorrow to Gertrude, Ophelia reveals the secrets both characters keep and proves how insightful she truly is. Ophelia withholds giving a daisy to anyone in the play in order to proclaim the honest fact that there is no innocence left, thus calling those around her hypocrites for placing such bounds on her own sexual desire while they commit such vile acts as murder and adultery. Ophelia’s revelation of truth in her madness effectively portrays the idea that young women like her had to be “mad” to talk about sex or go against the male-established rule of the time. When Ophelia accomplishes this feat, her pure sexuality and individuality shine forth, and even her brother Laertes notices this when he comments, “Thought and afflictions, hell itself she turns to favor and to prettiness” (Shakespeare 4.5.211-212). Mabillard even remarks that “in [Ophelia’s insanity] we hear from time to time an undertone of the deepest sorrow, but never the agonized cry of fear or horror which makes madness dreadful or shocking.” Ophelia’s madness, therefore, is not a state of weakness but one of ultimate strength, which Shakespeare elucidates to stress the importance of women remaining true to their own desires. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Ophelia’s death, which puts an end to her earthly madness, ultimately reveals her lasting heroic state. Some say that “Ophelia is the sacrificial lamb,” but she is not some sort of “victim, allowed to suffer by an uncaring and cynical world, until she melts away” (Mellor). Rather, Ophelia’s death is a triumph over the oppression of a male-delegated society. Amidst the incest and chaos, with characters being murdered for their betrayal or mere ignorance, Ophelia dies for a passionate purpose, the lack of being able to express her true, powerful identity. Torn between two extremes, Ophelia faces conflict because the overbearing and contradictory male world, symbolized by Polonius and his expectations, does not make clear what she should be, yet she is expected to obey regardless. Ophelia loves her father and tries her best to obey his wishes, but “Polonius prostitutes his daughter” (Mabillard), using Ophelia’s alluring charms to learn more about Hamlet even though he had recently castigated her for being “most free and bounteous” to Hamlet in “private time” (Shakespeare 1.3.101). Later in the play, Hamlet even refers to Polonius as a “fishmonger” (Shakespeare 2.2.190) for treating Ophelia this way. Ophelia’s death, then, is not a victimized measure; it is a bold escape, for it sets Ophelia free from her duty to submit to male hypocrisy. When she dies, Ophelia’s sexuality is finally liberated in its entirety, thus completing the revelation of truth brought about through her madness. The diction Shakespeare employs in describing Ophelia’s death reveals this perfectly, for Gertrude references Ophelia’s inherent sexual nature by calling her “mermaid-like” and a “creature native and endued unto [the water]” (Shakespeare 4.7.201, 204) to demonstrate that “the picture of [Ophelia’s] death…is still purely beautiful” (Mabillard). Gertrude’s description of Ophelia concludes with her saying, “But long it could not be till that her garments, heavy with their drink, pulled the poor wretch from her melodious lay to muddy death” (Shakespeare 4.7.206-209). While some may take this to mean that Ophelia’s death is passive, as the garments symbolize the male world pulling “the poor wretch” down to her “muddy” end, Gertrude’s jealousy is ultimately at work in her description, causing her to depict Ophelia’s escape from the world she herself must continue to endure as one with no happy end in sight. In reality, though, Ophelia triumphs through her departure from the play’s stream of chaos and disarray and even comes to serve as a firebrand for truth. For example, at the conclusion of Act Five, Laertes admits his true feelings toward Claudius before meeting his brutal end, much like Ophelia does before her own death, and Gertrude, possibly propelled by Ophelia’s courage in disclosing the honest truth, disobeys Claudius by drinking the glass of wine he tells her not to drink. Through her escape from earthly conflict and chaos, Ophelia transforms herself into a tragic hero, inspiring others to follow in her footsteps of candor.</p>
    <br>
    <p>While the story of Ophelia is one of tragedy, it ultimately reflects the emancipation of her true sexual identity. As a result of her internal conflict between obedience and desire, further pressured by her father’s contradictory actions, Ophelia delves into a unique state of madness in which she sings songs of truth and delivers flowers to those who conceal tainted secrets. By doing this, she proves that none are truly innocent, then meets her ultimate end, dying a beautiful and freeing death in the open water. Ophelia serves not only as an inspirational heroine for characters in <em>Hamlet</em> but for women past, present, and future; through Ophelia’s life and death, Shakespeare communicates the vital theme that women must express their true selves, feminine desires and all, rather than act as slaves to male instruction. This lesson escapes the bounds of time itself, for it still holds immense relevance today, several centuries after Ophelia’s fictional death.</p>
