    <h3>A Daily Dose of Vulnerability</h3>
    <h5>February 3rd, 2022</h5>
  </div>
  <div class="main">
    <p>Four years ago, I began my sophomore year of high school as an extremely soft-spoken student. I developed tactics to prevent teachers from calling on me in class and marveled at their efficacy, until the day that my English teacher announced a mandatory oral presentation. I made my way to the front of the classroom, sweat-coated pencil in-hand. But as I listened to myself speak, the glue that melded my fingers to my pencil gradually melted away. I spoke authentically about the ways in which I empathized with the literary characters that my classmates and I studied, and throughout the next few weeks, I began making a concerted effort to voice my perspective in class. I came to live vulnerably by sharing pieces of my story, continually opening myself up to the possibility of my most heartfelt emotions and deepest convictions being blown to smithereens. It was through this process that my heart first managed to break open.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Practicing vulnerability in class brought my teacher to suggest that I join our school’s Speech Team. By sharing personally relevant experiences through poetry and prose, I started to see vulnerability as a sort of medicine, one that could have harmful side effects but was worth taking for its heart-opening, community-building, opportunity-producing benefits. Yet as I reaped its rewards, I began to notice the ways in which others seemed not to share the same value. I watched my peers practice pseudo-authenticity, posting images on social media that shared their stories but only the most picturesque pieces. I witnessed others give people pre-packaged parts of their narratives, parts to which they had already grown immune. I sensed them wrapping their broken hearts in impenetrable gauze so that they could receive the benefits of vulnerability without facing any threat of emotional harm. Surrounded by peers who likely deemed themselves vulnerable, at least to some extent, I started to wonder how I could consider myself immune to these plagues of false vulnerability. Perhaps I at times shared only the pleasant snapshots of my life. When I did share the ugly, maybe I too rehearsed my tragedies, erasing the potential for heartbreak so that I could skip to my heart breaking open.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Palmer describes how rather than consider this tension something to be relieved, I can practice creative tension holding and store it in my heart, letting it produce what it may (13). But I find it difficult to sit in the tension that I experience in my relationship with vulnerability. I continuously contemplate whether I fall prey to the false types that I identify, and I fear the fact that both forms exhibit a sort of conformity that people seem not to recognize. Pseudo-authenticity conforms to widely held standards of beauty, while rehearsed vulnerability expresses the common notion that emotional hardship should be avoided rather than viewed as potentially generative. If we conform to preexisting norms and ideas, we fail to challenge those around us to be their fullest selves; we fall into the crowd, lacking a unique influence that we can use to impact others. When my English teacher reached out to me about my speaking talent, she spoke genuinely about how she considered my contributions in class to be special. She dared me to be the best version of myself that I could be. I decided to engage openly in her response, letting her vulnerability shape me in ways that likely would not have occurred had she chosen to hold true to the standard that teachers do not express whole-hearted, personal sentiments to students. I grasped what Palmer means when he quotes Tocqueville, stressing that “feelings and opinions are recruited, the heart is enlarged, and the human mind is developed, only by the reciprocal influence of men upon each other” (42). But this realization concerned me, as I witnessed numerous peers choose not to break away from the status quo. They buried their faces in social media feeds, altering their posts to bring societally appraised replicas into an online world rather than place their most genuine selves into our community.</p>
    <br>
    <p>As I consider the social media example, I gradually recognize that the online realm can be a powerful avenue for social change. Even though I do not consider it vulnerable to voice my perspective online, I notice that it is a great stride for some people, much like speaking up in class originally was for me. There is no single valve through which vulnerability can pump beautiful, reformative power. But there are undoubtedly clots, or ways of being that prevent such change from flowing into the world. The most harmful clot that I recognize is a sense of invulnerability, the refusal to recognize the emotional harm that will inevitably come our way. When we delve into online likes and comments, we at times evade the atrocities happening in our own communities. We can come to see ourselves as invulnerable and thus fail to acknowledge the problems and potentials that exist within ourselves and our societies. If we cannot challenge ourselves to let our hearts break apart and open, I wonder whether we can challenge others to do so. In a world where many choose to conform, how can we inspire the reformative growth that our communities deserve and demand?</p>
    <br>
    <p>When I think more deeply about invulnerability, I begin to see it as a form of privilege. I consider how those who are marginalized in society are often forced to be vulnerable, given no choice but to share sensitive information with strangers in order to receive government benefits and raise awareness of their situations. As Dr. Jim Withers describes, it can even be excessively challenging for those whom society disregards, disrespects, or denigrates to practice vulnerability. He explains that “it’s hard for folks on the street to open up that much, to let you know that they have feelings, because they’ve learned to protect their feelings, to not expect too much, to not really trust” (One Bridge to the Next). Bell Hooks additionally discusses the complex sensation of belonging. She shares how belonging is intrinsically connected to survival, implying that those who feel that they do not belong are already emotionally battered (Hooks 218). Being vulnerable in a place that does not accept you for who you are seems like an overly demanding and potentially impossible task. How could I have continued speaking up in my English class if my views were constantly suppressed or disparaged? Those whom society oppresses tend to hold a disproportionately low level of control over the telling of their stories. Some have learned to survive by practicing emotional invulnerability when they can hold their stories as their own, but at times, I find myself wanting to exploit this fact, to broadcast their vulnerabilities in hopes of improving their situations.</p>
    <br>
    <p>During my Speech experience, I became accustomed to performing other people’s stories. I quickly learned that the most emotional renditions received the highest scores, so I heightened the passion in my pieces, sometimes even tweaking the original narratives to produce the best results. I think back to last summer when I completed my Shepherd Internship with the Campus Kitchen, and the other interns and I would travel to the Rockbridge Baths Farmers’ Market each Sunday to run a free produce table. Nine times out of ten, the people who visited our table would take very little food and leave at least a ten dollar donation in response. But one day, a man arrived at the market in what seemed to be a much different situation. He rode up to the pavilion on a tattered bicycle, which had only a small basket in the front to hold his belongings. He conscientiously covered his mouth with a makeshift mask—the neck of his timeworn T-shirt—and he wept quietly as he shared the fact that his mother just died. He trusted that she was already in Heaven. The man avoided most tables at the market because he did not have enough money. But when he noticed that ours was free, he took only one vegetable, placing it in his bike’s small basket to ride away and leave us with a piece of his story.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This encounter sent a pang of emotion surging through my chest. I yearned to tell others the story that I authored, the narrative of the kind man with unflinching faith and no money, the man impoverished in material resources but abundant in spirit and soul, the man whose mother just died, who could not afford nutritious food, who needed assistance. I wanted to put his face on a poster exclaiming <em>End Poverty in Rockbridge Baths!</em> I even longed to write an article about him to feature in a local newsletter. But as I now re-read my rendition of his story, I realize that I filled in some vital pieces with my imagination. Perhaps the man rode a bicycle not because he lacked the money to pay for other forms of transportation but because he was an avid exercise enthusiast. Maybe he was not forced to wear old clothes but simply liked the look of vintage. For all I know, the man whom I convinced myself I knew might have avoided most tables because he was so caught up in conversation. He may have taken only one vegetable because one vegetable was all that he needed to finish off that night’s dinner. I did not know this man’s story, but I wanted to embellish what I assumed. I wanted to make playthings of his vulnerabilities by sharing a story that I would call his own, making his life “less real than a picture” while working to enhance concern about issues of poverty in Rockbridge Baths (Tharoor 83).</p>
    <br>
    <p>To hold creative tension in this situation seems like letting injustice and inequality continue to infect our communities, just like allowing others to continue practicing pseudo-authenticity, rehearsed vulnerability, or invulnerability feels like a dangerous game. Sometimes, we need people to be vulnerable because their vulnerability impacts us so deeply. We need our boss to face higher levels of management and insist that they let us keep our job. We need our significant other to tell us how they feel when we tell them that we love them. We need people to let us embroider their vulnerabilities for the sake of a larger cause, for people with greater amounts of power to advocate causes on our behalf. At times, it feels like we should not sit creatively in tension, waiting to see what that tension will produce. Rather, we need to make a decision before those around us experience even more suffering and our fragile communities fracture as a result.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I realize that it may be overly demanding to insist that the powerless and the underprivileged act vulnerably. However, I also see that the same may be true for even the most powerful and privileged in our communities. Even though their positions tend to grant them more control over their own stories, it may nevertheless be excessively damaging for them to share those stories with others. I have experienced what it can be like to share a part of my narrative and get tormented in response. Although performing a poem about mental illness before my entire high school produced numerous positive remarks, a few strikingly negative ones cut me so deeply that my heart broke apart into microscopic pieces, ones that I feared I would never find. It felt dehumanizing to be vulnerable before people who did not deserve my vulnerability, and I needed time to recover before I could continue living authentically with courage. I understand that people may nonetheless depend on my vulnerability when I feel that I cannot provide it. Perhaps my privilege calls me to be vulnerable when my vulnerability could aid others. Without me, my boss might fire an employee whose livelihood depends on a steady stream of income. My significant other might feel so unheard and unloved if I do not speak up and share how I feel. Police officers and judiciaries may keep punishing people based on the color of their skin, imprisoning them only to release them back into society with little to no ground to call their own. There is no telling what could happen if I do not speak up in a given instance. But there is also no telling what could happen to me if I do. </p>
    <br>
    <p>I cannot deny that, sometimes, my medicine of vulnerability has felt more like a poison, a toxin of open, authentic courage that I injected to support someone else while I myself suffered. I hear echoes of Audre Lorde in the back of my mind, saying, “Caring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare.” I realize that I might need to reshape my long-held perspective on vulnerability. Though I have always viewed it as action, something that could be visibly recognized or audibly discerned, I wonder whether sometimes the conscious omission of action is the truly vulnerable deed. Maybe my decision not to show up in a given situation is vulnerable, since I expose myself to the terrifying potential of letting others down. If vulnerability can be invisible, the instances of false vulnerability and invulnerability that I identify may only be segments of people’s stories. I already contemplate whether I fall prey to the value-opposites that I discern, but who am I to assume that I exist in a crowd of conformists? How can I be so sure that my version of vulnerability is ideal, that I can rightfully cling to it while others practice different approaches to various degrees?</p>
    <br>
    <p>It is in this tension that I sit as I strive to write an extraordinary ordinary conclusion. I think back to my Speech performances, how each one struck the audience with a dramatic and conclusive ending. They knew that the story was over and left feeling satisfied, since they could carry with them a concise message to incorporate into their lives. But as I conclude this written contemplation of vulnerability, I cannot provide you with a solidified understanding. I myself will not walk away from this paper with a compact answer. What I will do is continue to recall the heart-building and heart-breaking moments that vulnerability has produced in my life. I am unsure whether this is a just way to move forward, but I will choose it anyway, never forgetting the feeling of my hand glued to my pencil in high school English class. To this day, I still wonder exactly what it was that enabled that glue to melt away.</p>
