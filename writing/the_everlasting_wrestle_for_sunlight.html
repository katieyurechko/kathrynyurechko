    <h3>The Everlasting Wrestle for Sunlight</h3>

    <p>What does sacrifice reveal about priorities, and what consequences does it reap? In Barbara Kingsolver’s novel <em>The Poisonwood Bible</em>, readers gain insight into this very question as they come to know husband of Orleanna and father of four, Nathan Price. After moving his family from Georgia to the conflict-ridden Congo, all so that he could convert African souls to his Baptist ways, Nathan strives to be seen as a courageous disciple before his God, even if that means jeopardizing his own family’s safety or neglecting the culture of the African people. While Nathan loses his family along the way, the value he places in righteousness and religion never waivers as he continues preaching the Gospel to his demise. Throughout her novel The Poisonwood Bible, Barbara Kingsolver uses Nathan Price and his sacrifice of his own family to symbolize imperialist powers’ disregard for African culture, ultimately exemplifying how “righteous” motives like his and the colonizers’ own prove fruitless in the end.</p>
    <br>
    <p>By sacrificing his own family to pursue his religious vision, Nathan reveals his uncompromising value in spreading righteousness and forsakes any meaningful connection with his family in order to do so. His loyalty to his cause blinds him to the real dangers that lurk in the Congo, one even being his own self. After Nathan rejects the Underdowns’ invitation to leave Africa, Rachel protests his firm devotion to religion by claiming that nobody will notice if she and her family return home to safety. From Ruth May’s perspective, Kingsolver then writes that “Rachel fell down hard before [Ruth May] even heard the sound of the wall and [Nathan’s] hand” (Kingsolver 238), showcasing through a child’s eyes the blatant and brutal truth, that Nathan’s steadfast trust in God goes hand-in-hand with sacrificing his own daughters’ wellbeing. Rachel alludes to this same phenomenon as she listens to her father recite Genesis Chapter 19. She muses, “I detest the part where Lot offered his own virgin daughters to the rabble of sinners…And his poor wife, of course, got turned to a pillar of salt” (27). By employing this biblical allusion, Kingsolver draws a parallel between Nathan’s allegiance to the Bible and the sacrifice he makes of his own family, as he himself offers his virgin daughter Rachel to the corrupt Eeben Axelroot and allows his wife Orleanna to turn into “Lot’s wife” (98), blinded by her mistakes. Nathan’s unwavering focus on religion even leads him to overlook his own daughter Ruth May’s death, merely muttering the words “she wasn’t baptized yet” (368) in response to her tragic end. He then proceeds to baptize the African children while the rest of his family mourns the loss of their youngest sibling and daughter, with Leah at last realizing that “[Nathan’s] blue eyes with their left-sided squint, weakened by the war, had a vacant look…[He] was a simple, ugly man” (368). This image allows Kingsolver to reveal the “ugly” emptiness of Nathan’s mission; his eyes, wounded by their constant yearning for righteousness, prove he is blinded to others’ needs. In the end, Nathan’s essence can be captured within one profound piece of imagery: “vines strangling their own kin in the everlasting wrestle for sunlight” (5). From the very beginning, Kingsolver suggests that Nathan himself is a vine, sacrificing his family to spread and obtain righteousness.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Nathan’s value in promoting salvation, which causes him to stay in the Congo despite his family’s objections, reveals that he acts without regard for those who rely upon him, just as the countries in power make decisions without the African peoples’ best interests at heart. <em>The Poisonwood Bible</em> itself can be read as an allegory for the colonization of Africa; in her novel, Kingsolver uses Nathan’s character to represent Africa’s greedy colonial powers. Through Adah’s voice, Kingsolver describes how “determined [Nathan] is to win or force or drag [the Congolese] over to the way of the cross” (70), using polysyndeton to emphasize Nathan’s degrading method in achieving his “righteous” mission, much like the Belgians’ means to drawing the Congolese toward their vision of “civilization.” Kingsolver uses Nathan’s garden to elaborate upon this idea. As Nathan clears a plot of land to grow his plants, Leah reveals his mindset as she says, “My father needs permission only from the Saviour, who obviously is all in favor of subduing the untamed wilderness for a garden” (36). This mirrors the justification imperialists use for taking over “untamed” land and its citizens as they claim that God would approve of their actions. Nathan not only sacrifices his family’s protection in the Congo but figuratively “shuts the window and returns to the world of his own making” (318), sacrificing the African peoples’ religious practices to impose on them his own Baptist teachings. Through this image, Kingsolver makes clear that colonial powers, like Nathan, sacrifice others’ beliefs to fulfill their own missions. They remain culturally ignorant, just as Nathan baptizes Ruth May’s friend without even knowing her name, let alone her friendship with his own daughter. In her last section, Adah thinks back on Nathan and remarks that he was just “one of a million men who never did catch on” (525). To be successful in one’s mission, Kingsolver alludes, one must care for those implicated in the mission itself.</p>
    <br>
    <p>By employing Nathan’s character to represent imperialists as a whole, Kingsolver conveys one all-encompassing message, that one cannot “help” anyone, whether that be through religion or civilization, by sacrificing peoples’ interests or disregarding their cultural beliefs. This is because, as Orleanna explains, “Whether it’s a wife or a nation [powers] occupy, their mistake is the same: they stand still, and their stake moves underneath them” (384). By this, Kingsolver suggests that a consequence of imperialism without care for the people is a disconnect and ultimate separation of the imperialist power from the conquered land. This is evident through Kingsolver’s clever organization as well; while Nathan’s wife and each of his four daughters tell of their journey in Africa, the journey in which he caused them to partake, Nathan himself remains without a single section told from his perspective. Therefore, he “stands still” in time through <em>The Poisonwood Bible</em> while the family he sacrifices becomes the dominant voices in their own story. This is not the only consequence of Nathan’s sacrifice, for as Rachel questions, “[Nathan] came on strong, thinking he’d save the children, and what does he do but lose his own?” (515). Kingsolver employs irony in this rhetorical question to stress Nathan’s blindness to the aftermath of his own deliberate sacrifice, just as the colonial powers themselves were blind to Africa’s true wants and needs. Adah metaphorically states, “Illusions mistaken for truth are the pavement under our feet. They are what we call civilization” (532) for this very reason; Nathan and the colonial powers were simply bringing to Africa a series of illusions—what they thought Africa was and what they thought Africa would be. In the end, Nathan dies a gruesome death after deliriously pursuing his mission, therefore foreshadowing the consequences of colonization for future imperialists who harbor this arrogant perspective.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Kingsolver’s use of literary techniques, most especially the allegorical character of Nathan Price, demonstrates for readers the role sacrifice plays in illuminating one’s own values while highlighting how sacrifice can give way to consequences of its own. Nathan Price, determined to impose his Baptist ways upon the Congo, sacrifices his family in order to achieve his goal. Meanwhile, imperialists devoted to bringing Africa to their “civilized ways” sacrifice its citizens in order to fulfill their mission. Through the character of Nathan Price, <em>The Poisonwood Bible</em> ultimately teaches readers that attempting to change something outside oneself requires understanding and regard. Without these crucial elements, Kingsolver reveals, lasting influence is not only elusive but impossible to attain.</p>
