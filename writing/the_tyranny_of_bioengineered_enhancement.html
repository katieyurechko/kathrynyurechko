    <h3>The Tyranny of Bioengineered Enhancement</h3>
    <h5>May 10th, 2021</h5>
  </div>
  <div class="main">
    <p>In March of 2019, the public anxiously awaited charges of some of the nation’s most elite in what came to be known as the college admissions scandal. Behind the infamous scheme was William “Rick” Singer, the head of an organization that “catered to anxious, affluent parents” (Sandel, <em>The Tyranny of Merit</em> 7). Not only did Singer know how to exploit the fears of rich socialites; he knew exactly what lay at the origin of those fears: yearnings for control that underly “the tyranny of merit." Renowned philosopher Michael J. Sandel coined this term to exemplify what he argues in his most recent book, that a society focused on the excessive efforts of its “winners” banishes grace, obscures our common fate, and undermines human solidarity (<em>The Tyranny of Merit</em> 25). The imminent possibility of using genetic engineering to extend lifespans and augment our core physical, cognitive, and emotional capacities threatens to exacerbate this tyranny: it would cater to an apparent need for mastery, much like that exhibited by the parents who bought their children’s way into prestigious universities (Sandel, “The Case against Perfection” 506). Thus, while the framework of modern American society does not allow for a morally justified use of human enhancement technologies, as they pose a serious threat to justice, the importance of preserving the dignity of human life suggests a universal ban on such technologies and requires a permanent abhorrence of them.</p>
    <br>
    <p>A key consideration in regards to bioengineering technologies is the further injustice that making them available could engender. It is challenging to ignore the differential abilities to afford these enhancements that will exist across lines of race, gender, class, and ethnicity, specifically within the United States. Initial access will be monetarily limited such that the technologies will aid the already advantaged in shaping the norms of society, gaining vital social connections, and obtaining even greater levels of wealth. Even Nick Bostrom—a supporter of technological enhancement—admits that those who are already ahead cognitively, likely through the receipt of higher quality education, will be the most likely to desire and pursue enhancements in the cognitive realm (Bostrom 225). Additionally, within the American social context of hyper-parenting and get-ahead-at-all-costs ideologies, it seems undeniable that the eagerness to extend one’s lifespan or augment one’s characteristics will be affected in large part by whether others would choose to do the same. The willingness of countless well-off parents to take control of their children’s lives simply to secure their admission to Stanford exhibits the pervasiveness of this mentality. In this sense, it seems that a “natural outcome of mixing elements of American society” would be a biotechnologically improved class, subdividing the nation’s preexisting hierarchy into one on the basis of technological gains (United States President's Council on Bioethics 204). Since the tyranny of merit and the extensive injustice that accompanies it plague American culture, it would be unjust to utilize bioengineering technologies until such realities are effectively combatted; the technologies cannot fix the issue by themselves, so a provisional ban must be put into place by the United States Federal Government and enforced throughout the nation. However, some argue that, if adopted, enhancement technologies will become so widely available in the future that their cost will no longer be of consideration; they will not remain “justice impairing” for long after they are introduced (Garcia and Sandler 255). But the fact that equal access may one day be achieved still allows the opportunity for those already ahead to gain further advantage. Some like Sandel argue that measures like taxing the rich for these technologies could impede this outcome. But this approach seems to append yet another band-aid solution to the “techno-fix” (Garcia and Sandler 264). Combatting social injustice strictly by policy does not address the root issue. Lasting notions of hierarchy and prejudice that dwell in the minds of countless citizens are the underlying problem—as long as they remain unabated, justice cannot be achieved.</p>
    <br>
    <p>One objection to my argument that human enhancement technologies are justice impairing involves the concept of moral enhancement. Proponents like Thomas Douglas hold that technologically offsetting counter-moral emotions such as racist attitudes would bring humans to have better motivations. They would be inspired to address some of the world’s most pressing issues, so it would be unjust <em>not</em> to pursue technological human enhancements (Douglas 238). However, a key weakness in this argument involves the fact that virtue enhancement technologies will likely remain unused by those who perpetuate injustice. For example, would an outwardly racist person admit the immorality of their bias and opt for technological intervention? It is highly unlikely, at least in modern society. This concept creates a dilemma that cannot be solved technologically: as long as injustice lives on in the minds of Americans, it remains unjust to adopt enhancement technologies, and such technologies cannot change the minds of Americans while such injustice exists. Even promoting cognitive enhancement in hopes that people will commit their increased intelligence to solving social justice issues is flawed. As Garcia and Sandler argue, “If a person who enjoys unjust advantages is inclined to protect and promote those advantages, when she gains access to cognitive enhancement technologies she will be more likely to use her additional capabilities to increase those advantages rather than to reduce them” (261). A last option would be to “level the playing field,” or use biotechnical intervention to compensate for inequalities that affect one’s place in society. But, as the United States President's Council on Bioethics posits, “An additional disquiet would still perhaps remain: the disquiet of using such new powers in the first place or at all, even were they fairly distributed” (203). This brings one to consider what the source of such a disquiet might be.</p>
    <br>
    <p>If the wealthy were to embrace bioengineering, there is at least one significant cause of concern—the injustice inflicted upon the unwealthy—but still, something exists beneath the surface: a problem that plagues the rich. When discussing the college admissions scandal, Sandel states that “everyone agreed that bribing and cheating to gain admission to elite colleges was reprehensible. But the outrage expressed something deeper than anger” (<em>The Tyranny of Merit</em> 8). This “something deeper” involves questions of who gets ahead in society and, more specifically, what is sacrificed in the process. Sandel principally makes the case for the erosion of critical social traits, such as solidarity. The more that individuals conceive of themselves as self-made, the more difficult it is for those individuals to see their fate as tied to that of others (Sandel, “The Case against Perfection” 508). This concept ultimately generates a toxin with the power to debase the common good (Sandel, <em>The Tyranny of Merit</em> 14). A shockingly similar issue exists in regards to human enhancement technologies. As people strive to get ahead by extending their lifespans or augmenting their core traits, they aspire to become “tech-made,” which could potentially be even more dangerous than the contemporary issues surrounding merit. This boundless technological drive to excellence greatly diminishes the possibility of seeking “a common good beyond the sorting and the striving,” as the sense of superiority that accompanies receipt of enhancements generates hubris, further dividing individuals into endlessly separable and exponentially isolated categories (Sandel, The Tyranny of Merit 15). Ultimately, the potential for the “ethic of mastery” to banish any conception of a shared fate threatens this seemingly insurmountable tyranny.</p>
    <br>
    <p>More problematic than this, however, is the implication made evident through an analysis of what about the admissions scandal is troubling when viewed at the individual rather than communal level. Guaranteeing one’s children admission into an elite university through bribery seems to be a clearly immoral choice. Yet if arguably moral methods like making large donations to the institution achieve the same result, there still seems to be something inherently worrisome about the act. Apart from ideas surrounding merit, or the fact that the children would not have “earned” their way into the university, there is a deep worry that a guaranteed admission would deprive them of a critical opportunity for growth that can be accomplished only through enduring authentic trials and tribulations. For instance, some share that being rejected from the college they had revered was one of the worst experiences of their life; however, it taught them true perseverance and how to live through disappointment. Enhanced emotions to impress interviewers or augmented cognition to dazzle deans through a perfect SAT score would not have allowed such an experience. Thus, this scenario maps onto the bioengineering debate quite beautifully. Much like securing one’s children admission to Stanford deprives them of growth in spiritual values, receiving technological enhancements to “grow” in intellect, physical appearance, or sought-after emotions deprives oneself of chances for genuine human development. It violates the dignity of a human life by reducing a person to a more robotic entity, incapable of “exercising one’s human powers well and without great impediment” as “a lifelong being-at-work” (United States President's Council on Bioethics 211). To elucidate this, it may be helpful to envision the runaway trolley scenario, in which an observer has the option to witness a trolley kill five people or to pull a lever so that it kills only one. While many hold that they would divert the trolley to save the most lives, this change of course comes at the expense of human dignity. It violates the means-end formulation of Kant’s categorical imperative—do not use a human being as merely a means to an end—because it utilizes the one person’s life as merely a means to saving the five. Changing the course of one’s own life through technological enhancement, as an observer may divert the trolley, dehumanizes oneself. It reduces a person to a manipulatable object merely to achieve some end, which is inconsistent with respecting the worth of a being-at-work by letting one’s life take its course without such aims.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Though some like Bostrom argue that a technologically enhanced human can still grow both morally and spiritually, just without “extrinsic spurs,” I respond that even if this is the case, the problem lies in the fact that becoming enhanced in such a way taints every opportunity for genuine human growth (Bostrom 231). The dignity of a human life is violated when even one enhancement, like height adjustment, is undergone, as it hinders possibilities one might not even recognize for hardship and sincere development. Some may still object by claiming that lifespan extensions do not have this negative consequence. However, I hold that the issue of human dignity is of too great importance to open the door to any gene-altering form of human enhancement. If achieving a more superior life in terms of intellect or other characteristics involves compromising a critical component of one’s humanity, as I argue it does, doing so is not morally justified. It necessitates an abhorrence of such technologies, for in any case, they deform the inherent worth of a human life. Though a liberal democracy like the United States is not prone to banning immoral choices such as that to become technologically enhanced, a permanent prohibition on enhancement technologies may be necessary to safeguard human dignity. A worldwide ban enforced by a more unified body of global governance appears to be the soundest solution.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The college admissions scandal is representative of the American drive toward mastery. Throughout my paper, I argue for a ban on what many see as tempting human enhancement technologies by discussing numerous appealing perspectives. I begin by explaining the ways in which bioengineering technologies threaten to exacerbate injustice in the United States and why this calls for their medium-term prohibition. I then refute the notion that moral enhancement is a feasible remedy for injustice, which prompts a discussion of the dangers to the common good and the human person that technological human enhancement would engender. These steps together promote my proposition, that lifespan extensions as well as augmented physical, cognitive, and emotional capacities must be despised and likely banned permanently. My argument suggests that we need to ask ourselves a critical question: do we aim to live more strictly by the principle of merit, or do we aspire to find a deeper appreciation for human dignity beyond all of our striving? If we answer “yes” to the second component of this question, we might just discover a way to reap the rewards of biotechnological advancements without falling prey to the allure of those that endanger essential parts of our humanity.</p>
