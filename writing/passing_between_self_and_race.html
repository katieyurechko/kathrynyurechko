    <h3>Passing between Self and Race</h3>
    <h5>February 7th, 2019</h5>
  </div>
  <div class="main">
    <p>Is there a perfect balance between honoring one’s own individuality and also belonging to some greater community? Beginning in the late nineteenth century, African Americans experimented with this quandary by “passing” as members of white society and disregarding their individual pasts, only to discover that such an action brought them no closer to the happiness and security they undoubtedly sought. In Nella Larsen’s novel Passing, readers gain insight into the mind of Irene Redfield, a black woman who leads a stable life in Harlem along with her husband Brian and her two children. However, after watching her childhood acquaintance Clare Kendry pass as a white person, Irene finds herself torn as she struggles to uncover the balance between loyalty to herself and her own life or loyalty to her race as a whole. Readers soon discover that Irene is not alone in this conflict though, for Clare is emotionally suspended between the two extremes as well. Throughout her novel <em>Passing</em>, Nella Larsen employs juxtaposition and contrasts to stress the unstable balance between one’s obligation to race and the desire for individuality, highlighting how painful it can be trying to find the ideal equilibrium.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The concept of race is introduced along with Clare Kendry, whose conflicting character traits juxtaposed against one another display Irene’s complex attitude toward race itself. Throughout the novel, Larsen writes of Clare through Irene’s point of view, first showing how Irene regards Clare as an emotionless acquaintance she had known long ago. However, readers soon learn another aspect of Clare, the complex side that Irene finds herself constantly longing toward. Larsen writes, “Sometimes [Clare] was hard and apparently without feeling at all; sometimes she was affectionate and rashly impulsive” (11). The diction in this sentence alone, seen through the juxtaposition of “hard” and “without feeling” versus “affectionate,” suggests that Irene sees Clare, as she does her whole race, as something that traps her but also draws her in and gives her adventure. To Irene, “[Clare] was selfish, and cold, and hard. And yet she had, too, a strange capacity of transforming warmth and passion, verging sometimes almost on theatrical heroics” (10). Clare, although “cold” and repulsive to Irene at times, gives Irene “warmth” and feeling, just as Irene’s racial obligation can be selfish by taking her away from her own personal desires but can also provide her with a warm sense of community. While Irene finds Clare’s personality troubling and contradictory at times, her ability to seek out the good in Clare demonstrates how she will never truly be able to abandon her race, thus introducing the struggle Irene endures as she fluctuates between loathing and admiring the race to which she belongs.</p>
    <br>
    <p>As the novel progresses, Irene grows increasingly admiring of Clare, contrasting Clare’s beauty with the lack thereof in herself and others, as she longs for her own individuality. Larsen writes, “Clare, exquisite, golden, fragrant, flaunting, in a stately gown, whose long, full skirt lay in graceful folds about her slim golden feet; her glistening hair drawn smoothly back; her eyes sparkling like dark jewels. Irene, with her new rose-coloured chiffon frock ending at the knees, and her cropped curls, felt dowdy and commonplace” (75). The brevity of Irene’s description, detailing her “cropped curls” and the “frock ending at her knees,”  juxtaposed against Clare’s syntactically long description with beautiful diction like “glistening hair” and “full skirt…in graceful folds” suggests Irene’s displeasure toward her own allegiance to race as she longs to be a commanding individual like Clare is. This idea is further expressed at another point in the novel when readers meet Gertrude, another past friend of Irene’s, who openly passes as white. While having tea with Gertrude and Clare, Irene views Clare, whose husband is not aware she is truly black, as having “pale gold hair, which, unsheared still, was drawn loosely back from a broad brow…Her lips, painted a brilliant germanium-red, were sweet and sensitive and a little obstinate. A tempting mouth…the ivory skin had a peculiar soft lustre” (30). Irene then proceeds to evaluate Gertrude, who “had grown broad, fat almost, and though there were no lines on her large white face, its very smoothness was somehow permanently ageing. Her black hair was clipt, and by some unfortunate means all the live curliness had gone from it” (36). Irene’s near disgust toward Gertrude, who openly passes and disregards her true black identity, displays Irene’s disdain toward abandoning one’s race. However, the juxtaposition of Clare’s admirable traits like her skin’s “soft lustre” and her “pale gold hair” against Gertrude’s “permanently aging” skin and “black hair [with] live curliness…gone from it” ultimately portrays Irene’s longing for the seemingly-timeless individual freedom that Clare finds by passing in secret. Together, these instances of juxtaposed descriptions express the love of individuality Irene seeks at times but the adherence to race she feels obligated to uphold in others.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Clare’s innermost values, when contrasted with Irene’s, represent the mentalities both characters maintain as they choose to honor either their individual identity or the race to which they belong. Irene, a loyal member of her racial community, values safety and security above all. Larsen writes, “To [Irene], security was the most important and desired thing in life. Not for any of the others, or for all of them, would she exchange it” (112),  which shows that Irene would rather be safely trapped in loyalty to her race than risk “any” or “all” things for her own desires. Clare, however, “would do anything, risk anything, to keep [her husband] from finding out the truth [about her passing]” (113), proving that Clare does not care about being safe and would risk not only one thing but “anything” she has for her individual freedom, which she receives by passing as white. Irene and Clare also hold opposing views on motherhood. While Irene places her motherly responsibility above her own emotions, claiming, “It hurt like hell. But it didn’t matter…If the boys were safe” (97), Clare openly admits that “children aren’t everything” (83) and says her daughter Margery is “all that holds [her] back” (111). This contrast in motherly values demonstrates how Irene forever places her maternal nature over her individual feelings, just as she constantly remains true to her race above her own desires; however, it simultaneously displays how Clare would place herself over her motherly duties time and time again, just as she continually places herself above her responsibility to race. Irene and Clare’s morals, when contrasted against each other, represent their true feelings about race and individuality as well as the reasons they feel drawn toward the one or the other.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The juxtaposition of Irene’s changing emotions toward Clare display her constant fluctuation between loyalty to herself and allegiance to her race. When Irene and Clare coincidentally encounter each other for the first time in years, Irene’s initial reaction toward Clare is one of cautious optimism. Larsen describes how “[Irene] was sure she would have classed [Clare’s smile] as being just a shade too provocative for a waiter. About this one, however, there was something that made her hesitate to name it that” (16). However, once Irene learns that Clare has been passing, her attitude toward Clare shifts from one of willing kindness to scornful disapproval as Larsen writes, “Again that odd upward smile. Now, Irene was sure that it was too provocative for a waiter” (19), proving that Irene does not support Clare’s choice in abandoning her black identity. Upon Irene’s second meeting with Clare, a similar phenomenon occurs. Readers learn that, before getting together with Clare, Irene decides she is “through with Clare Kendry, a woman whose life had so definitely and deliberately diverged from hers” (31), but when Clare comes to see Irene anyway, Irene’s attitude shifts as Larsen inquires, “What was it about Clare’s voice that was so appealing, so very seductive?...[Irene] was even a little glad she had come” (34). Irene’s juxtaposed reactions toward Clare, especially when coupled with the prior pairing, demonstrate how Irene wishes to hate Clare for passing and disregarding her race, but she cannot help being attracted to Clare’s courage in doing so. Later in the novel, Clare attends a tea with Irene and Irene’s husband Brian. Irene’s initial reaction to Clare’s attendance is “Clare! What a nuisance!” (89) and “Clare! How sickening!” (91), but readers later discover that “Irene couldn’t remember ever having seen [Clare] look better…Yes, she was stunning” (94). In this instance, Irene initially hates Clare and calls her a  “nuisance” for disturbing the peace and security of her family, but once again she is swept away by attraction to her race and her duty to protect it, instead viewing Clare and the race she represents as “stunning.” Larsen, by juxtaposing Irene’s fluctuating attitudes toward Clare, exemplifies for readers the struggle Irene endures, forever suspended between herself and her race.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The juxtaposed jealousies Irene and Clare feel toward each other represent their excruciatingly endless yearning for the indefinite balance between race and self. Clare, on the one hand, is jealous of Irene’s lifestyle of safety, which is representative of Irene’s careful allegiance to race. When discussing the troubles that come along with passing, Clare asks Irene, “How could you know? How could you? You’re free. You’re happy. And [you’re] safe” (68). Larsen’s sequential placement of three short sentences in this quote effectively places emphasis on the words free, happy, and safe, therefore displaying how Irene can never truly comprehend Clare’s intense longing for her race because Irene has always had access to the freedom, happiness, and safety Clare desperately desires. Irene, unlike Clare, has forever remained loyal to her true black identity, and Clare envies that. Irene, however, is jealous of Clare’s lifestyle of passing, in which Clare values herself above any racial belonging. Larsen writes, “If Clare Kendry’s appearance had in it anything that was, to Brian Redfield, annoying or displeasing, the fact was not discernable to his wife as, with an uneasy feeling of guilt, she stood there looking into his face while Clare explained that she and he had made their own introductions” (75). Irene, jealous of Clare’s relationship with her own husband, fears Clare’s attractiveness as such a commanding and individual presence will take Brian and her secure life away from her. These contrasting jealousies Clare and Irene feel toward each other unveil their underlying longing for the way the other lives; while Clare longs for the connection to race that Irene maintains, Irene craves a deeper sense of individuality much like the one Clare possesses by passing.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The characters’ conflicting views toward passing and their involvement in it exemplify the constant struggle that exists in attempting to balance one’s individual freedom with one’s belonging to race. On behalf of her whole racial community, Irene states, “We disapprove of [passing] and at the same time condone it. It excites our contempt and yet we rather admire it. We shy away from it with an odd kind of revulsion, but we protect it” (56). Larsen juxtaposes distinct words in this statement such as “disapprove” and “condone” to describe the anomaly of passing itself, thus displaying the love and the hatred that those who are inherently black feel toward having such a choice. Irene and Clare exemplify this conflict perfectly, for while Clare passes and Irene tries her hardest to disapprove of it, Irene secretly longs for what Clare has. However, Irene and Clare’s juxtaposed loyalties to race and self, respectively, illustrate the impossibility of balancing the two extremes. Larsen writes how “[Irene] was caught between two allegiances…Herself. Her Race. Race! The thing that bound and suffocated her” (100), displaying through choppy syntax how Irene is confined and even stifled by her race because of her allegiance to it. Clare, however, is trapped within herself and rather isolated from her racial community because she passes. Unlike Irene, who wishes to grow stronger in her identity and sense of self, Clare longs for her race, saying, “You don’t know, you can’t realize how I want to see Negroes, to be with them again, to talk with them, to hear them laugh” (73). Larsen’s repetition of the word “to” in Clare’s dialogue visually enumerates for readers the various aspects of belonging that Clare earnestly craves but cannot come to know, simply because she chooses to pass as white. Through her use of contrasts, Larsen reveals that Clare and Irene share one commonality; although they lead utterly different lives, they both wish to find the perfect medium between the two things they seek the most: their individual identities and their race.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Larsen’s use of juxtaposition and contrasts visually demonstrates for readers the immense conflict that exists between honoring individuality and remaining loyal to one’s race. Irene, faithful to her blackness over her development of self, views Clare Kendry as a complex individual with beauty that far surpasses her own because of Clare’s strong allegiance to her own identity over her race. Clare, however, longs for the loyal connection to her racial community that Irene has always maintained. With opposing values as well as jealousies motivated by differing circumstances, Irene and Clare feel trapped within their race and personal identity, respectively, without being able to find the elusive balance between the two. As Passing teaches its readers, trying to find stability amongst the various facets of one’s life is a painful and exhausting endeavor, but it is a struggle in which all of humanity must partake. While the relationship between oneself and one’s greater community has no ideal balance, the search for such an equilibrium demonstrates for mankind the unfailing nature of loyalty itself.</p>
