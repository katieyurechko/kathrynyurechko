    <h3>Comparing and Contrasting Rhetorical Strategies</h3>
    <h5>October 11th, 2018</h5>
  </div>
  <div class="main">
    <p>According to the Cambridge Dictionary, guilt is defined as “a feeling of anxiety or unhappiness that [one has] done something immoral or wrong.” Because guilt is such a powerful emotion, it has the wrenching capability of tormenting those who let it into their hearts and minds. Both Ellen Goodman and Jonathan Edwards zealously address and employ this fact about guilt in their pieces “Putting in a Good Word for Guilt” and “Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,” respectively. Although both writers address the same topic, Goodman writes in an attempt to convince her readers of the human morality displayed through guilt, while Edwards uses his speech to instill guilt in his audience’s souls and bring them to beg for God’s mercy. Goodman and Edwards alike employ strong rhetorical strategies in their writing in order to effectively deliver each of their pieces’ messages about guilt; however, while they both use figurative language and diction to appeal to their audiences’ emotions, the two writers differ in their uses of other rhetorical strategies in order to properly fulfill their own pieces’ distinct purposes.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In her work “Putting in a Good Word for Guilt,” Ellen Goodman cleverly uses rhetorical devices in order to awaken readers to the reality that guilt itself is not necessarily a bad thing; in fact, guilt is actually one of the few emotions unique to human beings. The first rhetorical strategy Goodman employs to further this point of hers is parallel structure. In paragraph one of her work, she writes, “Yes, guilt can be the excess baggage that keeps us paralyzed unless we dump it. But it can also be the engine that fuels us. Yes, it can be a self-punishing activity, but it can also be the conscience that keeps us civilized,” to directly contrast the common negative perceptions humans have of guilt with the positive ones they, for the most part, seem to overlook. However, in Edwards’s writing, rather than implementing parallel structure, he tends to repeatedly use specific, powerful words to further his purpose. Another rhetorical device specific to Goodman’s writing is her heavy employment of ethos, which she uses to assert her credibility as a trustworthy source by showing readers that she too experiences feelings of guilt. An example of this is when Goodman writes how “each of us has a list [of things that make us feel guilty]” (paragraph 21) in order to express the commonality of guilt she shares not only with her audience but with all mankind. Goodman also uses personal anecdotes to further her credibility and her overall message about guilt. She writes about how, when she lectures her daughter, “[she is] doing precisely what [she is] supposed to be doing: instilling in [her daughter] a sense of right and wrong” to show how making others feel guilty can actually be a very good thing. Finally, while Edwards’s piece centers its rhetorical aim around pathos, Goodman’s piece more completely incorporates all parts of the rhetorical triangle. For instance, to strengthen her point that guilt itself is not evil but is rather a wholly human emotion, Goodman uses a plethora of logos by quoting other authors in a factual manner. In paragraph fifteen, for example, she summarizes how an author named Karl Menninger wrote that “one aim of psychiatric treatment isn’t to get rid of guilt but ‘to get people’s guilt feelings attached to the right things.’” By implementing this factual excerpt, Goodman successfully strengthens her argument by appealing to her audience’s sense of logic. Although Goodman’s implementation of rhetorical appeals differs in some ways from Edwards’s, each strategy she uses specifically fulfills her piece’s purpose by pointing out the positivity of guilt.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Separate from Goodman’s work “Putting in a Good Word for Guilt,” Edwards’s “Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God”  successfully places guilt in a negative light and uses it to bring sinners to repent through the use of harsh repetition and emotional imagery. While Edwards’s work might not seem incredibly lucrative at first, the sermon itself instills in previously nonchalant sinners not only an intense fear towards an outraged God but a feeling of extreme, sinful guilt, which calls them to repent. Unlike Goodman, who uses positive vernacular in her piece to create a more optimistic outlook on guilt, Edwards chooses to repeat harsh, stygian words such as “wrath” (paragraph 6) and “hell” (paragraph 5) in order to impress negative connotations of guilt as well as a rife amount of fear into his audience’s souls. Edwards also differs from Goodman in his writing by his employment of powerful imagery, which he uses to paint in his audience’s minds a view of a wrathful and impassioned God. For example, in paragraph twenty-eight of his work, Edwards uses visual imagery when he writes, “If God should only withdraw his hands from the flood-gate, it would immediately fly open, and the fiery floods of the fierceness and wrath of God would rush forth with inconceivable fury, and would come upon you with omnipotent power.” This quote vividly depicts for Edwards’s listeners the great amount of strength God must continually invoke in order to stifle his wrath, therefore pressing on sinners’ emotions and causing them not only to fear God but to feel guilty for the burden their numerous sins constantly place on a being who expends so much energy to protect them. In paragraph thirty of his work, Edwards employs imagery once again when he paints a clear picture for sinners of the danger that faces them by describing it as “a wide and bottomless pit, full of the fire of wrath, that [sinners are] held over in the hand of God.” By employing imagery in this example, Edwards vividly describes to his sinful audience how God has kept them safe from the danger caused by their sins, thus placing not only fear but guilt into their souls once again for disappointing such a merciful and protective God. Altogether, as seen through his use of foreboding repetition as well as emotional imagery, Edwards successfully uses rhetorical strategies throughout his speech in order to guilt sinners into returning wholeheartedly to the church to beg of God’s forgiveness.
	Despite their differences in rhetorical strategy, which are employed to target their pieces’ separate purposes, Goodman and Edwards do share some of the same rhetorical techniques in their writing. Their vast use of figurative language, for example, promotes pathos as it instills intense emotions, whether of guilt in Edwards’s speech or of relief from that guilt in Goodman’s writing, in their audiences. Edwards uses numerous similes and metaphors to alert his audience of the urgent need for repentance by describing God’s wrath as “black clouds [that are] hanging directly over [their] heads” (paragraph 3) and by warning them that “God is like great waters that are dammed for the present” (paragraph 3). Goodman, like Edwards, cleverly employs figurative language when she metaphorically describes guilt as “the adult in each of us, the parent, the one who upholds the standards” (paragraph 23) to illustrate how guilt really can be a good emotion because it facilitates morally just behavior. Not only do both authors employ figurative language in their writing, but they also use strong diction to invoke an emotional response or understanding in their audiences; although Goodman’s diction is significantly more positive than Edwards’s, both authors still share this commonality in their pieces. In paragraph eight, for example, Goodman describes how “a rich crop of guilt” grows between our past adherences and our present beliefs, thus showing through beautiful diction how guilt can form a bridge between old and new ways. Edwards, in a similar way, uses extremely impactful diction when he exclaims, “What would not those poor damned helpless souls give for one day’s opportunity such as you now enjoy!” (paragraph 10) to instill in his audience a strong sense of guilt for not begging of God’s forgiveness in the present moment when they have the chance. Therefore, both authors, despite their separate goals regarding guilt, heavily use emotionally-based rhetorical strategies to fulfill their pieces’ own specific purposes.
</p>
    <br>
    <p>Within both Jonathan Edwards’s sermon “Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God” and Ellen Goodman’s piece “Putting in a Good Word for Guilt,” the two authors make use of rhetorical strategies to further their points about guilt in comparatively different yet surprisingly similar ways. As both writers strive to use their audience’s emotions for their own benefit, they succeed in progressively using those emotions as tools to grasp their audience’s attention and instill in their listeners and readers whatever message they crave most to deliver. In fact, both authors make it immensely clear through their writing that guilt is one of the most viable emotions one can implement in order to persuade others. The media, for example, uses this precise emotion constantly when discussing the norms of society, in a way similar to that of Edwards’s piece. Through its use of this emotion, the media guilts many people, both male and female, into feeling as if they must always fit in with new trends of the modern day and age; however, while this message can bog down modern society, many communities have worked together to combat this feeling of negative guilt by spinning it in a more positive light, just as Goodman urges her readers to do. Therefore, due to the intense feelings that erupt forth from guilt, both Edwards and Goodman are able to creatively use it in alliance with rhetorical strategies in order to push for a metamorphosis in their audience’s actions and perspectives regarding guilt itself.</p>
