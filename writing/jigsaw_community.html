    <h3>Jigsaw Community</h3>
    <h5>January 13th, 2022 and April 2nd, 2022</h5>
  </div>
  <div class="main">
    <p><b>Contemplating a Jigsaw Community</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>My mom and I recently completed a jigsaw puzzle of a fictional town. Cartoon people spoke with one another. Some danced. A few played with their children. Others walked their dogs, gazed longingly through their windows, leaned against the railings that traced their rooftops’ edges. The unique people and situations captured within this town made it beautiful, bringing my mom and me to inhale the words of its unspoken story as we put its pieces together. Each neighborhood, house, and person held a vital place in this network of collective beauty. To leave out even a single piece of the puzzle would be to exclude the narrative that it would contribute to a communal story.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Envisioning my own community as a puzzle, I understand the inimitable impact of my contributory pieces. Only I can introduce them through the beliefs and talents that I let flow out into the world. If I stop the flow, my pieces fail to exist, and the collective story bears holes that only my pieces can fill. At times, it can feel as though what I do with my life holds little significance. I delude myself into believing that someone else can produce pieces identical to mine. But when I lost a piece of the jigsaw that my mom and I were assembling, I realized that not even an expert artist could create an exact replica. Their piece could never be the same one that I lost. This experience helped me realize that my role in my community is to show up, to create my pieces by channeling my life force, or sharing my unique gifts. Not only must I create my pieces. I must place them into my community’s puzzle by engaging respectfully with others. Otherwise, they could become some of the lost ones.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Once I recognized the importance of each piece in a community’s narrative, I could not deny the importance of others’ pieces and my own in forming that narrative. Fellow community members and I contribute to the same communal story, which requires our unique influences in order to be complete. Before one contributes a piece to the puzzle, one must sincerely and nonjudgmentally attempt to understand others’ pieces. This effort is what underlies respectful engagement with others. Understanding allows me to connect my gifts with others’ gifts or even to join in the application of others’ talents. By knowing the shapes and sizes of others’ pieces, I can most effectively place mine in the collective puzzle. By meaningfully taking part in interactions with others, I can reciprocally shape others’ pieces and let them shape mine to make our communal jigsaw more whole.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Institutions play a pivotal role in the shaping of our pieces, helping us attain tools and seize opportunities to build stronger societies. For example, educational systems can encourage us to broaden our perspectives. They can introduce us to and connect us with people whose pieces have shapes and sizes unlike our own. They can teach us about the world in inclusive and engaging ways, supporting us in acquiring the skills necessary to listen to others and learn how their pieces exist within the community puzzle. By sharing parts of our story and cultivating genuine empathy, we can better understand what makes our communities more just, healthy, and beautiful. We can explore parts of the puzzle that we had never before noticed. If institutions facilitate environments that emulate these ideals, we can most effectively enhance our communities, constructing ones whose jigsaws glisten with pieces of unique shapes and sizes and whose connections radiate hues of understanding and respect.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Reconsidering a Jigsaw Community</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>As the semester comes to a close, my mind finds its way back to the jigsaw puzzle that my mom and I completed. I consider the fictional town of cartoon people, the unique families and individuals who danced, played, walked, dreamed, and doubted. The complexity of this scene made it chaotic, yet its plurality of activities welcomed a vibrant, uninhibited beauty. Assembling this masterpiece, my mom and I inhaled what we deemed to be the story of a community. We put together its pieces, marveling at the simultaneous diversity and unity that ebbed and flowed through each connection. Thinking back on the semester, I cannot help but contemplate how best to embody the jigsaw mentality. How can we as individuals, communities, and institutions both inspire and embrace the daunting differences that exist within ourselves?</p>
    <br>
    <p>I remember contemplating the impact of the pieces that I contribute to my community’s puzzle, realizing that only I can introduce them through the talents and perspectives that I let flow out into the world. Now I consider how deeply I allow my pieces to be reshaped by those around me. I understand that it is important to open myself up to the opinions of others, for thoughtful consideration and deliberative dialogue welcome more healthy and just communities. However, I must not let a drive to please squash my unique perspectives and idiosyncrasies. I must not blend with difference to the point that I erase my individuality. In response to this concern, I can practice existing in the tension of self and society. I can and should strive to hold this tension creatively to promote reciprocal growth between myself and those in my community.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Existing in harmony amidst difference is not something that comes easily. It requires that we consistently reevaluate and at times reconfigure our most deeply held commitments. Once I recognized the importance of my pieces in my community’s story, I could not deny the importance of others’ pieces in forming that narrative. At each attempted connection, we as individuals must strive to understand how our pieces best unite with the pieces of others. We must listen openly to those around us to learn more about their stories, rather than assume that we can paint their pieces ourselves. One practice that might support us in this effort is that of authentic curiosity, which encourages us to communicate with respect as we let the perspectives of others enter into our hearts, minds, and conversations. By genuinely striving to know more about the pieces that others craft, we can most respectfully place our own pieces into the communal puzzle. We can strengthen our communities by uniting respectfully with those around us, honoring their differences and the beauty that our connections create.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Institutions hold great power in facilitating these connections. To build more healthy, just, and beautiful communities, they must encourage their constituents to engage in dialogue across difference. For example, educational systems can invite members of the larger community to interact directly with students. They can provide opportunities for people to come together and practice respectful engagement with one another. However, institutions can instead choose to shy away from plurality. They can reinforce unhealthy ideas, like the notion that the only safe connections are those that we share with the people who are most like us. If institutions decide to encourage the diversity that we strive to embrace within and between ourselves, our communities can best emulate the jigsaw mentality. Our pieces can shine beautifully amidst plurality, retaining individual spark while developing more fully in the company of others’ differences.</p>
